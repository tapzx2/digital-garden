Private messaged Oliver on Mastodon\nResources\nquick git refresher: rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\nProcess\nlocal test no problem.\n`npx quartz build —directory=../digital-garden —serve\n\nworks great locally!\n\nfrom terminal with standard .yml file from install docs\nnpx quartz sync --directory=../digital-garden\n\nThis builds a blank quartz instance in github pages.\n\nUpdate .yml file to:\nnpx quartz build --directory=../digital-garden\nrerun:\nnpx quartz sync --directory=../digital-garden\n\nThis builds a broken quartz instance in github pages.\n\nTest “normal” workflow. Make obsidian vault the content directory. Add content.\nUpdate .yml file to:\nnpx quartz build\nrun:\nnpx quartz build\nnpx quartz sync\n\nthis works just fine, but doesn’t follow Oliver’s process.\n\nQuestion and Understanding\nIF I understand correctly, the file structure locally for Oliver’s system is supposed to be\nfolder/\n    digital-garden/\n        obisidan-files-and-folders.md\n\tquartz/\n\t\t.git/\n\t    .git-stuff/\n\t    content/\n\t\tpublic/\n\t\t    this-is.xml\n\t\t    what.html\n\t\t    quartz.js\n\t\t    builds.css\n\t\tquartz/\n\nThis works great locally.\nAfter sending the stuffs to github, the directory structure looks like this.\nquartz/\n\t.git-stuff/\n\tcontent/\n\tpublic/\n\t\tthis-is.xml\n\t\twhat.html\n\t\tquartz.js\n\t\tbuilds.css\n\tquartz/\n\nSo, when the github pages server runs the npx quartz build --directory=../digital-garden command from the .yml file, it doesn’t work. There’s obviously no digial-garden directory to build from. I made the git repo inside the quartz folder. Pushing my whole vault to a public github repo wouldn’t make sense. So, how do I make this work with your workflow?\nSide question for my understanding, why is the github pages server being instructed to build quartz again? It seems like all of the needed files are in public directory."},"test":{"title":"test","links":[],"tags":["public"],"content":"Content here"}}
