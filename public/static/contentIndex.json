After a tour of the garden focusing on bamboo fences, there will be a discussion on types and styles, followed by a demonstration and hands-on tool practice and knot-tying session under the guidance of Sada and staff gardener.\nPhotos\nphotos.app.goo.gl/HxzmbRp4mGZhr9ib9\nLog\nDesigned wood fence is clear white cedar. Designed to replicate the visual depiction of a bamboo fence.\nBamboo quarter replace fence in the front of the house once a year. Depending on people that could be between 1 and 10 years for back of the house replacement.\nTea garden calls for the simplest form of bamboo fence. Typically it’s something that the team master or owner of the tea House will do.\nBamboo canes of Japanese garden can be prune frequently. This allows you to control both height and number and thickness. You can cut back to the ground. If The bamboo foliage is not heavy then the roots don’t have to push out and expand. This is the main thing that helps you control bamboo growth. Note that there are 600 700 year old bamboo portions inside homes In Japan that have not destroyed their courtyards or patios.\nTraditionally a student will go and make this fence in the master will fall behind them cutting off the knots that suck ass. The Masters will also be watching to make sure that they aren’t wasting too much material.\nFor cedar posts you can not dimension but harvest as is and use the round posts and it will last 50 to 100 years.\nThe fountain there is a clay pot that is upside down with a hole in it creates a resonating sound so that you can really hear the water. Every 20 years you have to take up the pot, clean up, put it back in.\nJapanese gardening there is constant maintenance and continuous improvement and never stops.\nFor Japanese pruting they’re doing incremental small pruning all the time particular focus on summer because that’s  when you’re outside. There’s no bad time to prune.\nOnce bamboo flowers its probably done. But, if you clear cut the whole thing or you could take off all the flowers it will prolong the life of the bamboo. The flowering cycle is 60 to 70 years (?) maybe. Depends on bamboo. There’s some really interesting research on the giant bamboo check it out.\nAge of bamboo 4 to 7 years is ideal before harvesting. 9 to 10 years it starts to deteriorate. September is the ideal time to harvest because it’s the time of lowest sugar content and the bugs won’t get in. This is in Japan where it has a clear four seasons.\nKakehi bamboo spout\nShishi odoshi deer chaser\nBamboo Design Options\n\nfences\ndelineations\ngrates\nfountains\nedging\ngutters\ndownspouts (travels outside of bamboo)\nerosion control (make little small fences then you plant all along those bamboo places and then in 15 years once the bamboo disintegrates you have a vegetative hedge that prevents the erosion)\nplant/tree supporters\nhide fire hydrants\nGate. Shiori-do gate.\nLadders. They are very stable and tell you much before they break.\nrakes, brooms, dustpans\n\nBuilding a Fence\nFor long bamboo fence think about 7 ft between posts. You can use bamboo horizontal to support in the middle so no sagging. Put groves in posts so bamboo can sit.\nNotice that top is node cut. On vertical pieces. This is my structurally sound and it traps due in the morning. This helps to slow down the drying process and prevent splitting.\nMaking the fence. Drive posts. End posts should be inches taller.\nKnot\nWorking on tying the fence… Make sure black twine is wet Don’t want to dry out. Do not allow any criss crossing of the twine think about parallel railroad tracks. Flip up the loop before pulling tight. You can pull single strands to pull tight.\nDon’t move your left hand once you’ve pinned it.\nThink about building and holding tension with the rope, not your hands.\nWhen making the transition of free end and creating the base end loop, the “aha” moment was realizing you can pitch with a longer part of your thumb and pointer. Not just the tip. This allows you to maintain hold on the loop pieces and slip the free end out of the pitch and allow the base end loop into the pinch.\nPeople\nCalPoly landscape architect.

Strangely, they’re quite similar.\n\nabsolute beginners\nprofessionals\n\nIf someone is in between those two levels, I’m teaching them how to dance rather than what to dance.\nWith both beginners and pros, I use similar conceptual models and progressions. With pros, we’ll go behind the curtain of curated content and discuss it.\nThis is the progression I use for pro level dancers. For beginners, I’m often teaching them in groups and their experience is highly curated.\nThis progression is for professionals in a one to one session in about 1 or 2 hours. Adjust as desired.\nLearning Collegiate Shag Basics\nShag is One Pulse\nI conceptualize the base unit of shag as a single pulse.\ni.e.\n\nOne pulse = a quick\nTwo pulses = a slow\nThree pulses = part of fancy rhythms\nFour pulses = skates or collegiate kicks\nSix pulses = hesitation kicks\nEight pulses = kick throughs or skates\n\nYou can mix and match the pulses with weight changes to create shag rhythms.\n\nTry leading / following all of those standard rhythms with your feet together, just doing weight changes and applying the rhythms.\n\nIn shag, you’ll have the most success if you focus on the leg your weight is on. The free leg is the show, everyone looks at it, but it isn’t the important leg. Focus on the leg with your weight.\nShag Rhythms and Patterns\nAnd there are many shag footwork patterns. The one that will give you the most gains right away is the basic - basic - shuffle basic.\nLet’s add in quicks. When I practice alone and want reps, I usually do basic - rhythm - single or basic - rhythm - triple because they’re bilateral. This helps to avoid building too much asymmetry. Plus some really cool moves use these rhythms.\n\nDo the single and triple rhythm basic side by side.\n\nHowever, unless you’re dancing with other high level dancers, socially its 90% basic - rhythm - double.\n\nLead / follow different positions, turns, and passes. NO RHYTHM CHANGES.\n\nMix in the Step Kick + Scoot\nThe second basic to integrate is the basic - basic - step kick. This works well in all dance positions @Ryan Martin has listed in the Shag Lexicon except for closed. It kinda works in closed. I suggest using different basic for closed.\n\nTry just the step kicks (the slows) of the basic - basic - step kick\n\nThe most important part of this shag is the scoot. This scoot will make you efficient and save you from exhaustion. Introduce yourself to moving around with it.\n\nTry the the six directions of movement and focus on the scoot while doing the step kick.\nTry moving far and fast too!\n\nFor closed, I will often use the basic - basic - double kick as my default. This can be a regional thing. loc_Los Angeles will use this more. loc_Austin may use basic - basic - arthur murray basic.\n\nPractice transition from open to closed and changing basics. Use the basic - basic - shuffle basic or basic - basic - arthur murray basic in closed and then the basic - basic - step kick in open.\nIf time allows lead / follow different positions, turns, and passes and include transition into closed.\n\nPulse and Center of Gravity\nBeginners will often pulse high and stay there. Experienced shag dancers will use the whole spectrum. Socially, the important thing is to match with your partner. It will allow you to sync well and avoid exhaustion.\n\nTry high, medium, and low center of gravity while doing basic movements.\n\nRhythm work is being able to comfortably lead / follow however many pulses on each foot.  Use a relaxed tone and then when something changes, tone up, use more compression, try a lilt, or a hitch (or other level changes) to indicate a change. Once a rhythm is established, you can usually relax again.\n\nLead and follow mixed rhythms with feet together, just doing weight changes and applying the rhythms.\nLead and follow mixed rhythms in closed.\n\nMore Steps\nLet’s quickly skim some common and iconic shag motions to do before we’re done:\n\ncollegiate kicks\nbunny hops\nskates\ncamel hops\n\nConclusion\nOkay! That’s enough for the first session.\nFor the second session the focus is on the Getting the Scoot in Shag.\nChoose Your Own Adventure\nThere’s shag specific lead/follow technique in many of the patterns.\nFor future partnered practices:\n\nStart with rhythm work.\nDance a lot.\nPractice what you’re interested in.\n\nFor solo practices:\n\nFocus on the scoot.\nPractice turns.\nConsider: LA Style Shag Warmup\n"},"Cyber-Security-Clearance-Level":{"title":"Cyber Security Clearance Level","links":[],"tags":["public","cybersecurity","reference_note"],"content":"\nConfidential Clearance\nSecret Clearance\nTop Secret Clearance / Sensitive Compartmented Information\n\nref: www.cyberdegrees.org/resources/security-clearances/"},"Desert-Specific-Gardening":{"title":"Desert Specific Gardening","links":["ipomea-batatas","moringa-oleifera","ricinus-communis","ficus-carica","punica-granatum","lavandula","malpighia-emarginata","ocimum-basilicum","initial-plant-research-phoenix-garden"],"tags":["garden","public"],"content":"Conclusions\n\nscreen soil for bermuda grass - doubles as decompaction for soil - add mulch or coconut coir for organic matter and aeration if you can wait out nitrogen drain.

This has been a literally years long process to find pants for dancing that look good and fit right. Hoping this will save someone else some pain. If you just want the bullet points, go to the TL;DR.\nWhere’s the Waist\nClothes come standard. Bodies do not.\nThere are three measurements to start with.\n\nWaist\nHigh Hip\nHip (aka your booty)\n\nThere is almost no pair of pants pants you can buy today in a regular store that are made to fit at your actual waist. Pants today are made for your high hip.\nBut where’s your waist?\nIn the gym communities, waist is often defined as the narrowest part above the iliac crest and below the bottom ribs. This can be difficult for some to find reliably (again, because bodies are different) so one common piece of advice is to use the measure at your belly button as an alternative. On me, my belly button is actually below my waist.\nThis is what those lines look like on me. Please forgive the gym progress selfie.\n\nOn a skeleton those points would look like this. The waist however, may not be where I drew the line. The narrowest part could be slightly lower or higher. I just guessed.\n\nWhen you take a look at people showing how to measure for trousers, they sometimes generalize the terminology. In this video, the “waist” being measured is what I use the term “high hip” for.\n\nThe Gentleman’s Gazette wrote an article on some of the terms used for pants and what they can do for different bodies. In this image they’re talking about low, mid, and high rise pants. Mid rise pants just aren’t a thing for me, they are super uncomfortable and don’t stay in place.\n\nMy legs are a little bit on the shorter side and my hip / torso a little longer. This means pants at high hip for me are not going to look good like they do on @Ryan Martin. Ryan is tall and has long legs. I haven’t seen him shirtless so I just guessed where is waist is.\n\nThe pants that I theorized would good on me are pants that sit on the waist. This is boxer John Hazel in 1948 wearing a beautiful pair of pants.\n\nThe very first pair of pants to fit me the way I wanted were these. Notice my belly button isn’t visible because it is lower than my waist.\n\nHow to Figure Out Pants For You\nRight now my waist is 37”, my high hip is 39”, and my hip (booty) is 46”.\nIf by some stroke of luck I could find pants that were made to fit at my waist (aka high rise) and not my high hip (aka low rise), off the rack won’t fit. Any pants that fit my waist aren’t making it past my thighs and booty. Pants that fit my booty are going to balloon around my waist.\nIt took a lot of trial and error before I realized my body isn’t the problem. It is the off the rack clothes. I’ve tried on lots of pants. Realized that I needed pants that fit me, not me trying to fit my body to pants.\nI bought pants from Goodwill that fit my hips, were high rise, and were the style I was looking for. Then, I learned ONE skill in sewing to fix the waist.\n\nIf you don’t know what looks good on you, what I suggest having a light meal and then head over to a well stocked Goodwill and try on A LOT of pants. Take photos. Do this at multiple locations across several weekends. You may need to bring some binder clips to take up some of the fabric when viewing in the mirror.\nPleats\nTo look swing, it is generally better to have pleats.\nHow many to get is up to you and your tastes. Also your pant maker might have something to say about the subject. HOWEVER, if you like the way your body looks with out pleats, find a make it work for your style.\nColor\nI went with solid black a blue with a light pinstripe. I’m on the road a lot and wanted base colors that would match with most everything and everyone I danced with.\nMy daily drivers are black, and dark blue with pinstripe. I have had other colors like olive, khaki, brown, grey, and green in the past and I LOVED them but they just aren’t practical for me on the road. Spilling a very visible spot of oil on your khaki pants is a sure way to spoil the mood at the after party late night dinner. Especially if you need to wear those pants again in the competition tomorrow. With black it is a non issue.\nFabric\nOf course I want wool. Wool was is financially practical. And my pant maker doesn’t offer it. He recommended a light synthetic that doesn’t wrinkle easily and I’ve had no complaints.\nLength\nThis depends on your overall style choice. This video shows some LA legends and their varying pant lengths. @Jeremy Otth floods a ton. @David Frutos doesn’t flood any. @Stephen Sayer’s pants are in between where the socks show well when moving, but not really when just standing.\n\nI went with the flood while in motion look. I need my pants to work outside of swing dancing but I wanted the pop of color since I usually am in darks because of travel.\n\nI recently got one more pair of black pants that were several inches longer because it looks so not tango to show socks like this.\nSuspenders\nIf you wear suspenders without the alligator clips, you can get the buttons sewn to the inside of the pant waist when you get them made.

Consider growing into two articles: general philosophy (platform agnostic, low friction, flexible, no duplicates, findability) and into nuts and bolts (atomicity, names, folders, tags).\nA documentation system needs to be easy to setup and maintain, adaptable, and low friction.\nThis is a quick summary on organizing SOPs. This article covers how to make SOPs easily scannable, easy to categorize, and easy to find.\nUnless the SOP writing platform or the organization requires it, it is unnecessary to start with extensive organizational architecture. Having a general plan is enough.\nThese are the organizational tools we have:\n\nAtomic Notes\nFile Names\nFolders\nTags\n\nAtomic Notes\nThere are two ways to write an SOP\n\natomic\nlong and detailed\n\nMuch has been written about this in the PKM and programing communities. The applied TL;DR is that if you have subsections of an SOP that can be made into their own SOPs, consider doing it for readability, findability, and low friction updates. If it is better to leave it long, leave it long.\nCertain SOPs are a little more like home pages, giving general jumping off points to other SOPs. In cases like this, multiple resources are intelligently aggregated into a list or general how to page.\nFile Names, Folders, and Tags\nThese three things all work together to organize your documents so you can find them either through a search bar or through folder hierarchy.\nBased on my own experience and that of productivity many organizational gurus like @Tiago Forte, @Nick Milo, and @Anne-Laure Le Cunff, it is my strong opinion that in general, folder structures and tags should be made ONLY when the need arises. BUT, having a plan before you start is essential for organizations.\nFile Names\nMake titles clear and descriptive by distilling the SOP into a clear and if possible, single concept. For example:\n\nNeighborhood mailer marketing sop\nHow to determine a neighborhood area\nHow to zoom to an address in qgis\n\nTransclude of Quick-Start-to-Writing-SOPs#^098337\nWhen it comes to scanning a list of titles or trying to connect one SOP to another, you’ll be able see the title or retrieve keywords from memory much faster than a generalist title like:\n\ndirect marketing\nneighborhood area\nqgis zooming\n\nFolders and Tags\nOnce you have enough SOPs and you may need another layer of organization. Both folders and tags help with organizing and with finding information. Folders are a structured hierarchy and tags are very flexible. They do not work in opposition to each other, they are complimentary! @Tiago Forte wrote an excellent article on this.\nFolders\nContent is usually organized into folders.\nTypically this is the finder, or in web apps the left side bar. This is for manual file navigation. A big upside is it gives people a concrete structure to navigate, with folders and labels giving them visual feedback and control in incremental steps.\nSystems have been developed for how to make folders. It is surprising that something so seemingly mundane has had so many hours of thought poured into it.\n\nPARA\nACE\nJohnny Decimal\nitGenius\nCyber Security Clearance Level\nmany many more\n\nAs annoying as it might be, “it depends” is probably the most accurate answer to “How should we structure our folders?” Which one you go with depends on the organizational needs and the platform you’re using for the SOPs.\nIn my opinion, the most important thing is not over do or over think. Just go with something simple and let more structure arise as needed.\nTags\nTags fill in the gaps of a folder structure. As an example, an SOP that lives in the ~marketing/neighborhood mailer folder needs to be finished. Instead creating and moving it to Nicholas’ to be completed folder, leave it where it is and tag it as #nicholas and #todo.\nHow you create implement and manage tags, again depends on the organizational needs and the platform you’re using.\nPlatform\nWhile these concepts are platform agnostic, the details of how to implement them, and how easy it is to implement them depends the platform.

Usually the area the people move around in is what they consider their neighborhood. Google helps with this by establishing a neighborhood name on google maps. At this level, you can’t see it.\n\nZooming out a bit more we can see that this area has been designated Cedar Hills. When this happens, that’s great! It helps give us more information.\n\nIf this is the kind of region we’re looking for, great! This would be the full Cedar Hills area. If this area is too big for the use case, continue on.\n\nBecause we create mental borders at physical barriers i.e. a river will denote the line between one country and another. In suburban areas, larger roadways perform this function. Think about walking a dog, you would not go past the exterior perimeter of your neighborhood. For a short walk, you might not leave the sub sections. This is an example of how the major roads create the envelope, and the through roads create the sub divisions.\n\nOur target address is in the bottom right sub division so, let’s use that as our area.

This is done with two painfully obvious steps.\n\nStart with a broad concept\nAdd more detail\n\nAs a completionist, I used to be shipwrecked by SOP projects where fully accurate processes were difficult or impossible to collect or create. Training myself to work incrementally and forgetting about an immediate need for depth of detail, rescued these projects. \nTo see this incremental process, below is an example of creating a first draft SOP over three iterations. The whole process can be expected to be produced in a fast session, about 30 to 45 minutes.\nLet’s begin!\nFirst Iteration\n\nIdentify the “what”.\n\nThe “what” defines the title of the SOP. A good title distills the SOP into a single concept. This is achingly important but if you don’t know of a good title, that’s okay! It can be changed later. \n\nDefine the “why”.\n\nThe “why” defines the objective. A good objective quickly gets to the point. Think 1 or 2 sentences. If it’s a bit verbose, that’s okay! We can refine it later.\nThe prompt: We are writing an example SOP for new employees working the cash register (the what) because we need someone to the run the cash register that’s not you and you want it done well (the why).\nOur first draft title could be something like: Standard Operating Procedure for Retail Employees Working the Cash Register. This isn’t the most compelling title, but it is clear.\nThe objective could be something like Objective: To ensure smooth operation of the cash register while providing excellent customer service in line with our company mission.\nNow that we have the title and objective, let’s incrementally add detail.\nLevel 1 Detail\nProcedure\n1. Start shift\n2. Handle transactions and issues\n3. End shift\n\nGreat, that took all of 10 seconds! Let’s add another layer of detail to End shift. We would normally do this for each step, but for readability I’m only going to add it to one of the steps.\nLevel 2 Detail\nEnd your shift\n1. Close the register\n2. Count and confirm accurate cash count\n3. Prepare the cash drawer for the next day\n4. Prep supplies for next shift\n\nLevel 3 Detail\nNow we’re getting into the nitty gritty… Let’s adding more detail to Close the register.\nClose the Register\n1. Stop transactions\n2. Print the end-of-day report\n3. Secure and deliver report\n\nLevel 4 Detail\nIn this SOP, now we are getting into the literal button pushing! We may not go into this level of detail in a first draft. In some cases, it is best avoided because this can become a significant time commitment! If we’re lucky, we can use documentation that already exists. In the case of our POS system, it does.\nStop transactions\n\n\nRef\n\nStandard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Retail Employees Working the Cash Register - First Iteration\nAfter showing the process of adding details, I filled a few other things out. This can start to feel a bit overwhelming. However, this is a good first draft and starting off point for writing an SOP.\n### Objective\nTo ensure smooth operation of the cash register while providing excellent customer service in line with our company mission.\n### Procedure - First Draft\n1. Start Your Shift\n\t1. Log in with your assigned ID\n\t2. Count and confirm accurate cash count\n\t3. Check supplies\n2. Handle Transactions\n\t1. Greet the customer\n\t2. Run the transaction\n\t3. Thank the customer\n3. Handle Issues\n\t- Price discrepancy\n\t- Returns or exchanges\n\t- Transaction error\n\t- Irate customer\n1. End Your Shift\n\t1. Close the register\n\t\t1. Stop transactions\n\t\t\t1. Refer to stoneedge.com/kb/articles/pos-ending-a-shift/  ![POS-Shift-Close.png](stoneedge.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/POS-Shift-Close.png)\n\t\t2. Print the end-of-day report\n\t\t3. Secure and deliver report\n\t2. Count and confirm accurate cash count\n\t\t1. Remove the cash drawer and count the cash\n\t\t2. Separate bills and coins\n\t\t3. Record the totals for each denomination\n\t\t4. Compare this total with the end-of-day report from the register\n\t\t5. Identify and report discrepancies\n\t3. Prepare the cash drawer for the next day\n\t\t1. Set aside the starting amount\n\t\t2. Prepare the drawer\n\t\t3. Deposit remaining cash\n\t4. Prep supplies for next shift\n\t\t1. Double-check that the register is locked and secured\n\t\t2. Clean and organize\n\t\t3. Return keys and reports\n\t\t4. Confirm there are bags and receipt paper\n\t\t5. Check out with supervisor\n\nPlanning the Second Iteration\nAfter the first iteration is completed, we can step back for a minute and think about how we quickly refine it and use it to help make some business decisions.\n\n“Deposit remaining cash” (step 1.3.3) is mission critical and could highlighted a little better in SOP.\nWe do not have the capacity to write the button pushing level of detail into our SOP nor do we have the capacity to train employees who might need that. This can help lead to writing clear job requirements. It may be important for the applicant to have some experience with POS systems or an aptitude for learning. Maybe in the future we would look into writing the button pushing docs. But for now because we’re trying to get this position filled.\nHandling issues could be considered critical. This jumps to the top of the list of SOPs to write.\nWe can probably prune the detail from the customer interaction, cash count, and supply check instructions. We’d would hire someone who’s good at this already. In the future, when a more robust training methodology is needed i.e. dutch bros training, then we could expand this.\n\nUsing the above points, the first draft can be tidied up into something like this.\n### Procedure - Second Iteration\n1. Start shift with a cash count and supply check\n2. Handle Transactions\n3. Handling Issues\n\t- Price discrepancy\n\t- Returns or exchanges\n\t- Transaction error\n\t- Irate customer\n1. End Your Shift\n\t1. Close the register\n\t2. Stop transactions\n\t3. Do cash count and prep cash drawer for tomorrow \n\t\t1. Remove the cash drawer and count the cash\n\t\t2. Separate bills and coins\n\t\t3. Record the totals for each denomination\n\t\t4. Compare this total with the end-of-day report from the register\n\t\t5. Identify and report discrepancies\n\t\t6. Set aside the starting amount\n\t\t7. Prepare the drawer for next shift\n\t4. Deposit cash by placing it in the cash pouch and going to First Republic Bank, deposit to the Yarns and Things Account. Do this after every shift before 5:30pm.\n\t5. Prep supplies for next shift \n\t\t1. Double-check that the register is locked and secured\n\t\t2. Clean and organize\n\t\t3. Return keys and reports\n\t\t4. Confirm there are bags and receipt paper\n\t\t5. Check out with supervisor\n\nPlanning the Third Iteration\nAfter organizing, the result is a tidy looking SOP that clearly sets expectations of our new employee. Using these expectations it will sharpen the job positing. It has also helped hight light the things we would need to provide to the new employee and set them up for success.\nHowever, it is a little unwieldy to scan and requires too much reading. There are also some steps that can be made their own SOPs.\nThere is also a question for the critical cash system of what happens if the employee misses the cash deposit cut off? After a quick think about this system, we can implement an updated version. The square brackets indicate [[links]] to another SOP. In the SOP platform they would look more like this: How to Organize SOPs.\n### Procedure\n1. Start shift with a cash count and supply check\n2. Handle Transactions\n3. Handle Customer Issues - [[Customer Policies]]\n4. [[Shift End Process]]\n5. Deposit cash by placing it in the cash pouch and going to First Republic Bank, deposit to the Yarns and Things Account. Do this after every shift before 5:30pm. If needed, you can use the night depository for an after hours deposit.\n\nAs an architect type planner, I used to be caught in the productivity trap of over designing systems. This was reflected in the SOPs It is helpful to keep in mind Gall’s law and remember that complex systems that work come from simple systems that work.\nThis 5 step SOP is a great first draft. It is simple, clear, and given us clarity on the next documents that need to be written. Thanks for hanging with this example until now!\nAfter writing 10 to 20 of these documents, we’ll need an organization system. Please have a look at How to Organize SOPs for a quick tour of organization principles."},"Ryan-on-Stephen-and-Chanzie-Style-aka-Double-Kick-Basic":{"title":"Ryan on Stephen and Chanzie Style aka Double Kick Basic","links":["@Ryan-Martin","Styles-of-the-Shag-Double-Rhythm-Basic","@Stephen-Sayer","@Chandrae-(Chanzie)-Roettig-Gomez"],"tags":["shag","public"],"content":"@Ryan Martin in comments on YouTube video of Styles of the Shag Double-Rhythm Basic:\n“Steve and Chanzie have a unique style. But if I had to place them, I’d say they have the most in common with Connie and Barbara (Basic #5). They don’t really have a lilt in their basic. Yet there is a very small amount of movement at the waist (like Connie and Barbara), which probably tells the follow what count her partner is on (like a lilt does). So it doesn’t make sense to lump them in with the folks that do the whole heels up business (basic #4). And they hold a wider gait, like Connie and Barbara. The most important thing, though, is the fact that they’re super smooth. Smoothness can be a relative thing, of course (i.e., a lilted basic can be smooth too, but it’s a different kind of smooth). My point is, Connie and Barbara’s smoothness shows in the fact that their heads don’t move up and down hardly at all during the basic, which is the way Steve and Chanzie dance. They make it look effortless. …I think Sailor Mike would also be a part of this same LA tradition. Smooth. Very little bounce.

Rocking a baby worked much better to create the lilt.\nTelling people “I am going to use the phone as a memory trigger outline because when I get excited I get distracted, and I’m so very excited to teach this class.” Was excellent for contextualization. Consider printing outline out. Or maybe even writing on mirror? Would like to try both in future. Phone is great for portability, but does provide a visual trigger reminder to others to look at their phone. Maybe not an issue, but would like to try other methods.\nI was very limited on speaking in class because it was to mainly Korean audience and wanted to avoid translation time suck. Was nice to speak less, but I did get a little more sever perhaps, how to be more positive anchor without voice?\nLost Marcy. How to adjust class to keep her? She’s a good dancer and spoke English, but was frustrated. Was she panicked because of her fear of shag? Maybe a quick meditation or calm verbal cues would have helped.\nGood feedback from more skilled dancers. Less skilled dancers found it difficult. As expected for a workshop, so that’s good, but try to get ahead of any negative thoughts. Consider: “please review this workshop in 1 year and it will help you tremendously” and “show this video to your teacher and work through it together” and “you can always message me with questions” sentences to final speech.\nShould have gotten media right away.

Because people in the USA don’t want to learn the rules.\nIn Asia, this isn’t a problem. Instead, maybe consider that you are an artist, not a preservationist.

What can I contribute?\nSo, I share with you a way thinking about shag.\nShag is one pulse.\n1 = q\n2 = s\n3 = idk no name\n4 = skates or collegiate kicks\n5 = idk no name\n6 = could be kick throughs\nSolo, these are two bilateral basics.\nUse any of the basics and try single time.\nUse any of the basics and try triple time.\nNow, try one of my basics\n123 1 12 12 12\nPlease, take 5 invent a basic and practice it. Build upon tradition. It doesn’t have to be bilateral.\nOkay, please partner up. Teach your basic to your partner. You have 2 minutes each.\nMy answer has been “pure shag.” In the way Balboa has a rich dance in closed, I believe shag has the same. Uding these subtile and intricate communications, we can grow was we can communicate in open figures.\nI don’t know if it will catch on, it’s a very hard thing to entertain a crowd with. Huge benefit is that is that it is socially sustainable. Much less taxing (maybe). In a crowded room it’s hard to do shag. Bal is better. But only because bal knows how to be small. Much of shag requires opening.\nPerformance vs social dance.\nOkay, now let’s set a Rhythm. Use one of the four standard rhythms. And change the physical basic.\nOkay let’s partner and lead follow just weight changes.\nScoot basic\nRunning man\nScoot forward and back with kick\nKeep it simple\nWhat about starting with just the step kick.\nNo talking\nDo a lot of those.\nDo running man.\nDo hop back and forth no kick.\nHop back and forth with kick.\nBack to step kick.\nAdd a single and triple time.\nMove around the room.\nThis is maybe 6 to 10 minutes. Water.\nOkay good warmup!\nIntroduce weight changes exercise. Do it. A few rotations.\nTry switching to between single, double, triple, or extended double.\nNow try free form.\nKorea v America\nTool I use is one pulse. This covers freezes.\nHave every one try. Use in pulse idea. And any physical basic you know / like / want to try. I.e. kick, tap shuffle.\nGo back to weight change lead follow practice. Rotate a few.\nNow, let’s try a very shuffling basic. In fact, what does this look like?. Balboa right? One of my secrets of shag efficiency is to think Balboa. I see the feeling of energy and try to replicate it and it’s exhausting. Instead, find ease.\nDemo solo dancing.\nLead and follower rhythm changes with a shuffle basic.\nI think about building upon tradition and I think this is how I’m doing it. I think of pure shag the way that pure bal works. It isn’t great for performance, but it is exceptional for understanding lead follow and that’s been great for me in bigger motions.\nEach type of basic has their own tricks to leading and following. Ones with a slight side to side or lilt are the easiest. The step kick basic is quite hard. It’s what I’m working on now.\nOkay, let’s crank up the energy a little bit and start the step kick basic again. It’s what we use almost entirely in open so it’s very very good to get good with.\nWe do the running man to love the scoot to know and feel the scoot. Let’s restart those.\nDo a lot of those.\nDo running man.\nNow step kick. Now forward and back. Now circle. Left right.\nRunning man again.\nBack to step kick.\nAdd a single and triple time.\nMove around the room.\nThis is maybe 6 to 10 minutes. Water.\nOkay, now let’s talk about floating. No touching and gestures to get places. Key is to not force timing. Either leader or follower.\nNow, let’s talk about asking for timing.\nOutline\nWarmup (scoot prep)\nRespect tradition by building upon it\n\none pulse\npure shag\nBalboa efficiency\nsolo dancing\npure shag again\nScoot practice\nsolo reps / running man\nfloating as a style\nvs scoot spring\nTurns timing\nlead off of a…\n\nslow\nquick\n\n\nto lead a\n\nslow\nquick\n\n\n\nTestimonial from El about Triple Crown Workshop\nFrom Dongyun Shin aka El www.instagram.com/elsdy/\nThe lesson yesterday was amazing. The practice exercises you prepared to explain the concept and the way you built upon each concept step by step were excellent. Personally, it was very similar to the way I organize things, so it was easy for me to learn.\nAlthough it was only an hour and a half, I was able to better understand and think about the overall energy management in Leader-Follower Shag, and how to dance in a way that the Follower enjoys more and we can dance together for a longer time. It was incredibly helpful.\nThe concept of leading through energy management, such as weight shifting, the “banana” or “baby-sitting” techniques, and distance, is not only applicable to Shag but also to other dances as well. It was great to see how seriously Nicholas takes dancing and how well he organizes his thoughts.\nI have no doubt that you will become an amazing dancer, and I look forward to seeing your future growth. I really wish we could spend more time together and talk more, but it’s a shame that we can’t. Still, I am so grateful to have met you, such a wonderful dancer, in Korea. Though our time together was short, every conversation we had was heartfelt, and I could see how thoughtful and sincere you are. Every time, I could feel what a great person you are.\nI wish you the best in your future endeavors, and I hope you’ll come back to Korea someday. Until then, I’ll keep dancing, and I hope we can look forward to meeting again. Truly, you’re not only a great dancer but also a great person.\nSay hello to Stephanie for me, take care of your health, and when are you leaving?"},"Styles-of-the-Shag-Double-Rhythm-Basic":{"title":"Styles of the Shag Double-Rhythm Basic","links":["basic---basic---jig-kick","basic---basic---arthur-murray-basic","basic---basic---stab-basic","basic---basic---hook-basic","basic---basic---heels-up-basic","basic---basic---single-kick-la-style-basic","basic---basic---sailor","basic---basic---lift-basic","basic---basic---double-kick","basic---basic---step-kick","basic---basic---shuffle-basic","stompers"],"tags":["shag/classicShag","public"],"content":"www.youtube.com/watch\n\nBasic Patterns\n\n1:45 basic - basic - jig kick\n2:15 basic - basic - arthur murray basic\n\nbasic - basic - stab basic\n\n\n5:47 basic - basic - hook basic\n7:30 basic - basic - heels up basic\n8:48 basic - basic - single kick la style basic\n9:06 basic - basic - sailor\n10:19 basic - basic - lift basic\nin comments on YouTube: basic - basic - double kick\nnot listed: basic - basic - step kick\nnot listed: basic - basic - shuffle basic\n\nOthers\n\n1:02 stompers\n"},"Swing-Dance-Competition-Accomplishments,-Awards,-and-Performances":{"title":"Swing Dance Competition Accomplishments, Awards, and Performances","links":["2024-BCN-Shag","loc_Barcelona","Special-Triple-Crown-Shag-Workshop---Sept-10th-2024","@Triple-Crown","2024-Bal-Hop","loc_Seoul","2024-Swinging-by-the-Sound","2023-Hot-Jazz-Jamboree","Portland-State-Faire-2023","Rhythm-Wrecker-Dance-Band","2023-Swingin-by-the-Sound","2023-Hot-Rhythm-Holiday","2020-Camp-Hollywood","2019-Camp-Hollywood"],"tags":["public"],"content":"\n2024 BCN Shag\n\nIn loc_Barcelona finalist for advanced mix and match and 4th in strictly\n\nAdvanced Mix and Match: www.youtube.com/watch\nStrictly\n\nall skate 1: photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipNvbkOcvCm7pb23UrMp95lPhqOZeXzLbe_zqzaR\nspotlights and all skate: www.youtube.com/watch\n\n\n\nSpecial Special Triple Crown Shag Workshop - Sept 10th 2024\n\nAn absolute honor to teach at the legendary @Triple Crown studio.\n2024 Bal Hop\n\nIn loc_Seoul finalist for bal hop cup, 3rd in shag strictly, 2nd balboa am m&amp;m, 1st in shag mix and match\n\nbalhop cup\n\nqualifiers:\n\nheat 1: www.youtube.com/watch\nheat 2: www.youtube.com/watch\n\n\nfinals: www.youtube.com/watch\n\n\nshag strictly\n\nqualifiers: www.youtube.com/watch\nfinals and spotlight: www.youtube.com/watch\n\n\nbalboa am mix and match\n\nqualifiers:\n\nheat 1: www.youtube.com/watch\nheat 2: www.youtube.com/watch\n\n\nfinals and spotlight: www.youtube.com/watch\n\n\nshag mix and match\n\nqualifiers\n\nheat 1: www.youtube.com/watch\nheat 2:\n\n\nfinals and spotlight: www.youtube.com/watch\n\n\n\nPerformance\nSwing performance at Pie Milonga in loc_Seoul\n2024 Swinging by the Sound\nSecond in advanced shag mix and match: www.youtube.com/watch\n2024 Portland Lindy Society Instructor\nRegular instructor of shag at weekly event.\n2023 Hot Jazz Jamboree\n\nSecond in shag strictly.

I’m doing my best to keep a log of all the Swing Dance Competition Accomplishments, Awards, and Performances.\nFirst intro to Shag was a class from Kate Elisabeth and Julie Roman in 2018 in Phoenix. Learned a bit from @Stephen Sayer and @Chandrae (Chanzie) Roettig Gomez. I was gifted several blood transfusions from @Julie Roman and that helped a lot. Planned to do a lot of traveling for Shag  in 2020… Back on track in 2023 and I’ve been enjoying participating in all the shag events and comps I can! I love coming up with new things, particularly rhythm changes. But realizing that all the things I’m “inventing” Jeremy Otth already put on instagram. Practicing and teaching regularly around the world.\nI’m currently working on putting together an expansive compendium in preparation to creating an online school. This is one of the article I’ve written to help sharpen my thinking and process: Collegiate Shag Demystified - A Simple Progression for Professional Dancers. I also write articles to help answer questions that I often hear from newer dancers. How to Get Men’s Pants for Dancing is an example of something I wish I knew when I started!\nAs I’m getting older, I’m finding Balboa is calling my name. I dance Balboa when I’m too tired, lazy, stiff, sore, hurt, chill, calm, or achy to dance Shag. I dance Balboa often and I’ve been pleasantly surprised that a lot of Salsa and WCS and Tango vocabulary and techniques can be imported into the dance.\nI dance Lindy Hop on teams or when the music is too slow for Shag or Balboa. I dance Blues when forced or tricked into it.\n2010 to 2020 - Puro Tango\n\nAfter studying in Argentina, in 2010 I began working independently as an Argentine Tango teacher. In 2014, my wife Stephanie and I won the USA Tango Championships and we decided to pursue dance full time. In late 2015 we moved to Phoenix, Arizona for economic opportunity.\nWe opened two studios, taught many private lessons, mentored to multiple national and international champions, and worked as instructors at UC Berkeley, Arizona State University, Empower College Prep, Arizona Opera, and Mesa Community College. Stephanie danced and acted in the Arizona Opera’s production of Maria de Buenos Aires.\nCombining all the tango training trips, I’ve lived in Buenos Aires for two years. This is why I have the Argentine accent while speaking in Spanish. All of my Spanish speaking friends make fun of me for it.\nIn Tango Class Recaps you can see a few class recaps from 2018 and 2019 when we teaching an open to all class in Phoenix at the language school Interlingua. We had a dedicated group of students where we applied the format of teaching moves while emphasizing fundamentals and adding 15 minutes of candy (stage-ish stuff) at the end.\nAfter this video of us dancing for fun in April 2019, Steph’s health started to take a turn for the worse. To continue dancing we detoured. I took up Lindy Hop and Shag and Steph started a coaching position with the Phoenix Swing Project.\n2005 to 2010 Salsa and Ballroom\nIn 2004 I started with a general partner dance class. This was prompted by a cute girl asking me to go with her. I continued with dance and started learning salsa from a local community class in Orinda put on by Tomaj Trenda. In college I joined cotillion and learned ballroom dancing from the legendary Kenji Ota and regularly went salsa dancing three nights a week. In 2009 I started working as an a new student specialist at Arthur Murray, Hayward."},"Tango-Class-Recaps":{"title":"Tango Class Recaps","links":[],"tags":["public","tango"],"content":"Tango Class Recap Videos\nBack hooks\n\nocho cortado variations\n\nRock steps\n\nDisassociation\n\nThe Cross\n\nQuick Quick Slow\n\nSandwiches\n\nThe Basic Step\n"},"Turning-a-3,500-Dollar-Prius-Breakdown-into-664-Dollar-Success":{"title":"Turning a 3,500 Dollar Prius Breakdown into 664 Dollar Success","links":[],"tags":["public","archived_project"],"content":"In August of 2022 I got the red triangle of death on my 2005 Prius.\nWhen the dreaded red triangle of death appears on the dash, it means something is seriously wrong. It often signals a major issue with the hybrid battery, which can be both costly and time-consuming to repair.\n\nA Prius battery issue isn’t as big of a problem on the West Coast, where these cars and repair services are plentiful. At the time I was living in Delaware, and local resources were scarce.\nCost and Risk Assessment\nAfter calling around I was quoted:\n\n$2,150 from a dedicated hybrid shop that would need the car for one week. However, it was hour drive and it was very possible I wouldn’t make it, incurring tow truck costs.\n$2,750 from a mechanic nearby with no warrenty.\n2,700 to 3,500 from the Toyota dealer down the street with a dubious warrenty.\n\n\nUsing napkin math I calculated the value of doing the work myself. If it took 70 hours of my time, using 3,000 as a baseline, I&#039;d be working/saving at 43.27 per hour. This would go down for any costs incurred and go up for any time saved.\nAfter a little research I learned that it was probably a few cells on the battery, not the whole shebang. Cells were 40 each I would probably need to replace three or four of them. After learning about the tools, I projected about 200 in equipment cost.\n\nAn estimated total cost of 360 and a budgeted 70 hours of time. Based on history, I double cost on projects that I have zero experience with. The time rate of 70 hours I had already inflated quite a bit. Doubling the expected cost to 720 still put me at a work/save rate of 32.57 / hr or 67k per year.\nWhile the tutorials were good and I had several engineer friends I could ask for help if things went south, I did have to accept the risk that it wouldn’t work at all. This would probably land me with the either the local mechanic or the Toyota dealer.\nBut in that case, I also had to accept the lack of warrenty from the local mechanics. The local mechanics didn’t have any experience with the Prius batteries. They would just have to figure it out. I couldn’t guarantee the quality of their work, but I was confident in my own abilities.\nWeighed these risks against the rewards, risking $720 to potentially save several thousand while picking up some interesting skills seemed worth it.\n\nIn the end, it cost me 664.73 and about 30 hours of labor spread across eight weeks. That&#039;s a work/save rate of 77.85 /hr or $161k per year. A pretty good deal!\nMajor Conveniences\nSome majorly helpful things:\n\nI had no immediate need for a car. I could easily and pleasantly bus/bike/walk/train to work, groceries, and entertainment.\nI was mostly work from home so I could watch over the battery during conditioning for safety reasons during the day.\nStephanie was out of town for 3 months.\n\nHaving Stephanie out of town was a huge help because no one else needed to use the car. And no one complained about the toxic gasses being emitted during the reconditioning process that forced me to leave the bedroom windows open through the night because it was a 1 bedroom apartment and the bedroom was the only place I could keep it where the cats wouldn’t climb on it and get electrocuted. Heh.\n\nProcess\nHere’s the project outline.\n\nconfirm battery issue\nresearch\nbuy tools and equipment\nremove the battery\ntest and recondition condition the cells\nbalance the battery\nre-install the battery\ndrive off into the sunset\nOf course, in the actual process there were 4 or 5 more “buy tools and equipment” and 9 or 10 “research” steps.\n\nTo efficient at managing my time, I would run the battery cell conditioning cycles twice a day. Starting in the morning before work and again about twelve hours later.\nChallenges\nI was living in a prim and proper apartment complex at the time and doing work on your car in the garage was not the kind of behavior or tenant that would have been acceptable.\nI couldn’t help but laugh as, in the dead of the night, I pulled the battery and carted it up to my apartment. I was fortunate no one saw me or complained.\n\nThe intent of anti car repair language was to prevent derelict looking cars, inconvenience to residents, and prevent safety issues. My plan, if someone complained, was to cite a passage in the lease clarifying that battery replacements were acceptable. Though it’s a big battery, it’s still just a battery!\nSome things I’d do differently:\n\nBuy the more expensive cells from the super wonk who does Prius battery reconditioning full time. Not going to him first meant I lost several weeks waiting after realizing the others I bought were worthless.\nSpeed up the conditioning process by buying balance chargers that could handle multiple cells at once.\nAt the time I wasn’t worried about it. But now after working in construction and knowing importance of safety equipment, I would buy (rent?) a fire extinguisher for electrical fires. The risk of fire is very low, but a fire extinguisher is not expensive and the danger is potentially catastrophic. It is a risk worth mitigating.\n\nResult\nSuccess! The voltage difference was down to .1 volts (excellent) and I came well within budget and time. Though… a little long on overall project duration.\n\nBonuses: It was fun. I got an excuse to learn about battery technology, electricity, and cars. It was also great conversation material.\nThe battery lasted over a year. Hurray! Once the cells start failing, others can will start to fail, so you’re looking at doing this work once every 12 to 18 months.\n\nIt failed again in October of 2023 but I was on the West Coast in Portland. I was super pressed for time, driving constantly to random locations, and the cost for an immediate battery replacement at my place was $1000 with a one year warrenty.\nIt was an easy decision to go with the replacement. Could I do it again? Yes, but I knew exactly what it would take to do the work and I didn’t have the time. I was extremely happy to pay someone else a reasonable price for a very convenient service."},"What-our-ideal-roof-jobs-look-like":{"title":"What our ideal roof jobs look like","links":[],"tags":["hawthorneGeneralConstruction","public"],"content":"We’re looking for single story ranch style homes with space around the property and minimal vegetation.\nA 27 sq 4/12 house with no valleys and 3 facets.
