Hello! Welcome to my personal site.

My name is Nicholas Tapia, I'm currently a fractional COO and traveling the world as a dancer. In my free time I research knowledge management, practice my Spanish, and do some mini design projects. In the past I ran a roofing company, started a venue rental company, and worked as a cyber security analyst at JPMC. My vision for the future is to build an online dance school and to become a public servant focusing on equitable transit and profitable urban design.

Areas of Focus
- [[For the Love of SOPs and Documentation]]
