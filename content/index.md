Hello! Welcome to my personal site. It is *under construction*.

My name is Nicholas Tapia, I'm currently a fractional COO and traveling the world as a dancer.

In my free time I research knowledge management, practice my Spanish, and do some mini design projects. In the past I ran a roofing company, started a venue rental company, and worked as a cyber security analyst at JPMC.

My vision for the future is to build an online dance school and contribute to meaningful work in infill development.

Areas of Focus
