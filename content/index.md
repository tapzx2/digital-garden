Hello! Welcome to my personal site. It is *under construction*.

My name is Nicholas Tapia, I'm currently a fractional COO, traveling the world, and dancing.

In my free time I research knowledge management, practice my Spanish, and do some mini design projects. In the past I ran a roofing company, started a venue rental company, and worked as a cyber security analyst at JPMC.

My vision for the future is to build an online dance school and contribute to meaningful work in infill development.

Areas of Focus
- [[Infill and Missing Middle Real Estate Development]]

- [[Diverse Projects]]
- [[How I Publish This Site - Obsidian with Quartz]]
