I love SOPs and documentation.

SOPs contain the recipes of a company. They lay the foundation for quality work and sustainable growth, making them particularly impactful to smaller companies and teams.

This concise set of articles combines research and my own experience, shaped by my training as an instructional designer.

We inherently want our work to have an impact. Implementing quality SOPs has that impact and it is my sincere pleasure to do this work.
