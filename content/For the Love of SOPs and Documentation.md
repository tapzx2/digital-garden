SOPs contain the recipes of a company.

They lay the foundation for quality work and sustainable growth, making them particularly impactful to newer companies or smaller teams.

I have distilled my experiences as COO and my training as an instructional designer into a concise set of articles to understand my approach to SOP writing, development, and best practices.

If you're interested in developing SOPs for your company, I invite you to please take a look at the links below.

- [[Which SOPs to Are Important to Write First]] - Struggling with which SOP to start with?

- SOP Resources - Under construction. Soon to have some deep dives and additional resources.
-  PKM system - Knowledge organization, acquisition, and production - How I approach my own knowledge management. These notes are a little harder to read since they're meant to be read by me!

If writing SOPs is something I can help you with, I look forward to working with you soon.
