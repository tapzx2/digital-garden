## Retrospective
Banana analogy didn't work for me. Rocking a baby worked *much* better to create the lilt.

Telling people "I am going to use the phone as a memory trigger outline because when I get excited I get distracted, and I'm so very excited to teach this class." Was excellent for contextualization. Consider printing outline out. Or maybe even writing on mirror? Would like to try both in future. Phone is great for portability, but does provide a visual trigger reminder to others to look at their phone. Maybe not an issue, but would like to try other methods.

I was very limited on speaking in class because it was to mainly Korean audience and wanted to avoid translation time suck. Was nice to speak less, but I did get a little more sever perhaps, how to be more positive anchor without voice?

Lost Marcy. How to adjust class to keep her? She's a good dancer and spoke English, but was frustrated. Was she panicked because of her fear of shag? Maybe a quick meditation or calm verbal cues would have helped.

Good feedback from more skilled dancers. Less skilled dancers found it difficult. As expected for a workshop, so that's good, but try to get ahead of any negative thoughts. Consider: "please review this workshop in 1 year and it will help you tremendously" and "show this video to your teacher and work through it together" and "you can always message me with questions" sentences to final speech.

Should have gotten media right away. Consider getting an iPhone just for easy media transfer.

Many thoughts on this and created:
How to Leverage Group Class as Funnel

- from run run, qq turn both sides

**small routined**
extended basic
triplett basic
3 slows 2 quick turn
opposite wall banger
shag lollies
passbys
nicholas break

End of class speech
Thank you for letting me share my perspectives on shag. Perhaps ask yourself, how do I build upon tradition? What can I contribute?
Stephen and Chanzie are a great example of building upon tradition, vomit comet and Harvey wall isbanger were not shag moves before they did them.

Finally, Thank you very much to Soochan and Young for giving me this platform and letting me teach here. And Thank you for being here, I appreciate your focus and attention.
## Long Outline
### Warmup
One song warm up with just step kick, back shuffle, and hitch
One song of of single and triple, with step kick and back shuffle
### Efficiency
show shuffle, differentiate between Arthur Murray and stab basic
show kick, emphasize soft knees and gentle scoot -> if kick basic is terrible, take a 15 minute detour at some point, but this is optional
### Land of Double
Follow along
- closed to open, do shuffle in closed, do either in open
- do position changes, open, two hand, one hand, 90, 45, facing, switch to cross hand, face front and back, back to two hand, try sliding doors
- this is floaty easy going timing aka, no timing.
- please think of a lindy move, strip the timing, and then try to use shag basics while doing it
### Land of Timing
Land of timing, This is a more typical class where you have a specific movement pattern and you do it at the set timing. Soochan and Young teach excellent classes with a great diversity of movement. I have been training here and I quite enjoy it.
### Philosophy Break
In USA I tell people: know the rules to be able to break them. Because people in the USA don't want to learn the rules.

In Asia, this isn't a problem. Instead, maybe consider that you are an artist, not a preservationist. Respect tradition by building upon it.
### Land of Rhythm
With that in mind, let's move to the land of rhythm. This is where I hope to have contributed to shag. Let's try leading and following rhythms. "Pure Shag"

Weight change leading
- quiet, small
- slow rhythm
- pulse rhythm
- to music

Lets try banana leading (aka lilt)
- feet should width apart
- rib cage warmup
- followers hand on rib cage
	- slows and extra slows
	- slows and quicks

Let's try distance leading
- slows have a side step, quicks are in place
- try by your self
- try lead and follow

Let's try side by side (okay to skip this one)
- what techniques, or combinations of techniques could you use?

Think about hand to hand (okay to skip this one)
- what invented techniques, techniques, or combos would work here? 
### Turn Timing
Use rotational (use as transition from rhythm section) hitch basic in open
- full change is slow, half way is quick
- use hitch and pony

Transition to turns
balboa uses gears
shag uses paddles (not sure the right analogy here)
- hitch basic repeat
	- l/f a qq turn
	- l/f a slow turn
	- Use either or as pay attention step. When showing use only inside turns to protect shoulders.
	- Mention at end that you can do outside
- run run basic
	- l/f a qq turn. Here's the vocalization, be sure to practice this!! The "turn" is the prep movement. ***1 2 3 4, turn 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4, 1 turn 3 4***
	- l/f a slow turn -> weird, but doable, do it on your own time, not very shag. Practice it before class, don't show this, but be prepared for the question.
### Small Routine
if time!
extended basic
triplett basic
3 slows 2 quick turn
opposite wall banger
shag lollies
passbys
nicholas break

## Development Process
Sent in description: Join us for "Mastering Collegiate Shag Rhythms," where you'll honor tradition while crafting your own sophisticated shag rhythms and steps. This workshop dives deep into advanced techniques, focusing on efficient movement that keeps you dancing all night. Be prepared to sweat as you refine your ability to lead and follow intricate rhythm changes, syncing perfectly with your partner. Whether you're a seasoned dancer or have solid shag experience, this session will elevate your skills and bring new precision to your dancing.

- for decent dancers or experienced with shag, maybe a little tricky for beginners but they could handle it if they were willing to struggle
- partnered, but it isn't required to have a partner. I can work with an imbalanced class as long as it isn't too extreme
- 90 minutes would be great
- we'll establish a framework for creating our own moves
- we'll work on making rhythms and how to lead and follow them efficiently
- we'll trouble shoot some common syncing issues
- we'll apply those rhythm changes in closed, double two handed open, and single hand side by side
- we'll work on the scooting action across several of the basic steps
- we'll work on leading and following different turn timings (if we have time)

### Important Points from Published Marketing
goal: a variety of people will be able to dance shag

I will help you create your own sophisticated rhythm and steps in the tradition of Collegiate Shag.

And while matching with your partner, you can develop the ability to lead and follow complex rhythm changes.
- Leading and following rhythm changes of closed, double two-hand, open, and single hand
- Building a framework
- Some basic steps of squatting movements
- Leading and following movements for various turn timings

We prepared this with the hope that various people will be able to perform various shags on the dance floor in the future.

### Collected Thoughts Throughout Month
for developing ideas, thinking about bilateral or trying the same thing in many different ways

this is not a shortcut to practicality, this is a space for creativity

for turns
balboa uses gears
shag uses paddles (not sure the right analogy here)
- hitch basic repeat, l/f a qq turn, l/f a slow turn, pay attention between either or. Use only inside turns. Mention at end that you can do outside
- run run basic, l/f a qq turn, 1 2 3 4, turn 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4, 1 turn 3 4, l/f a slow turn -> weird, but doable, do it on your own time, not very shag

Thinking about Tuesday class
Maybe different shag basics is interesting for the slows 
Also maybe 4 different traditional basics
Concept of chill and scoot, how to be efficient, think Balboa
Thinking about how to lead and follow - tango weight changes, banana shape, travel vs no travel
Quicks, slows, Collegiate kicks, skates -> repeat
Thinking about types of quicks. Shuffles, pumps


Shag
4 basics
Basic gliding
Changes positions
2 basics of slow
Many qucks side by side
Many qudina in front, use ha of slow to prep



Thinking about workshop...
What about level of pulse?

Start with 6 minute warm up:
1. Kick step
2. Double kick
3. Sailor
4. Single kick
5. Chugs
6. Back tap
7. Double kick front

In USA: know the rules to be able to break them.
In Korea: Respect tradition by building upon it.

Stephen and Chanzie are a great example, vomit comet and Harvey wall banger were not shag moves before they did them.

I have asked myself how do I build upon tradition? What can I contribute?

So, I share with you a way thinking about shag.

Shag is one pulse.
1 = q
2 = s
3 = idk no name
4 = skates or collegiate kicks
5 = idk no name
6 = could be kick throughs

Solo, these are two bilateral basics.
Use any of the basics and try single time.
Use any of the basics and try triple time.
Now, try one of my basics
123 1 12 12 12

Please, take 5 invent a basic and practice it. Build upon tradition. It doesn't have to be bilateral.

Okay, please partner up. Teach your basic to your partner. You have 2 minutes each.

My answer has been "pure shag." In the way Balboa has a rich dance in closed, I believe shag has the same. Uding these subtile and intricate communications, we can grow was we can communicate in open figures.

I don't know if it will catch on, it's a very hard thing to entertain a crowd with. Huge benefit is that is that it is socially sustainable. Much less taxing (maybe). In a crowded room it's hard to do shag. Bal is better. But only because bal knows how to be small. Much of shag requires opening.

Performance vs social dance.

Okay, now let's set a Rhythm. Use one of the four standard rhythms. And change the physical basic.

Okay let's partner and lead follow just weight changes.

Scoot basic
Running man
Scoot forward and back with kick

Keep it simple
What about starting with just the step kick.

No talking 
Do a lot of those.
Do running man.
Do hop back and forth no kick.
Hop back and forth with kick.
Back to step kick.
Add a single and triple time.
Move around the room.
This is maybe 6 to 10 minutes. Water.

Okay good warmup!

Introduce weight changes exercise. Do it. A few rotations.
Try switching to between single, double, triple, or extended double.

Now try free form.

Korea v America
Tool I use is one pulse. This covers freezes.

Have every one try. Use in pulse idea. And any physical basic you know / like / want to try. I.e. kick, tap shuffle.

Go back to weight change lead follow practice. Rotate a few.

Now, let's try a very shuffling basic. In fact, what does this look like?. Balboa right? One of my secrets of shag efficiency is to think Balboa. I see the feeling of energy and try to replicate it and it's exhausting. Instead, find ease.

Demo solo dancing.

Lead and follower rhythm changes with a shuffle basic.

I think about building upon tradition and I think this is how I'm doing it. I think of pure shag the way that pure bal works. It isn't great for performance, but it is exceptional for understanding lead follow and that's been great for me in bigger motions.

Each type of basic has their own tricks to leading and following. Ones with a slight side to side or lilt are the easiest. The step kick basic is quite hard. It's what I'm working on now.

Okay, let's crank up the energy a little bit and start the step kick basic again. It's what we use almost entirely in open so it's very very good to get good with.

We do the running man to love the scoot to know and feel the scoot. Let's restart those.
Do a lot of those.
Do running man.
Now step kick. Now forward and back. Now circle. Left right.
Running man again.
Back to step kick.
Add a single and triple time.
Move around the room.
This is maybe 6 to 10 minutes. Water.

Okay, now let's talk about floating. No touching and gestures to get places. Key is to not force timing. Either leader or follower.

Now, let's talk about asking for timing.

Outline 
Warmup (scoot prep)
Respect tradition by building upon it
- one pulse
- pure shag
Balboa efficiency
- solo dancing
- pure shag again
Scoot practice
- solo reps / running man
- floating as a style
- vs scoot spring
Turns timing
- lead off of a...
	- slow
	- quick
- to lead a
	- slow
	- quick
## Testimonial from El about Triple Crown Workshop
From Dongyun Shin aka El https://www.instagram.com/elsdy/

The lesson yesterday was amazing. The practice exercises you prepared to explain the concept and the way you built upon each concept step by step were excellent. Personally, it was very similar to the way I organize things, so it was easy for me to learn.

Although it was only an hour and a half, I was able to better understand and think about the overall energy management in Leader-Follower Shag, and how to dance in a way that the Follower enjoys more and we can dance together for a longer time. It was incredibly helpful.

The concept of leading through energy management, such as weight shifting, the “banana” or “baby-sitting” techniques, and distance, is not only applicable to Shag but also to other dances as well. It was great to see how seriously Nicholas takes dancing and how well he organizes his thoughts.

I have no doubt that you will become an amazing dancer, and I look forward to seeing your future growth. I really wish we could spend more time together and talk more, but it’s a shame that we can’t. Still, I am so grateful to have met you, such a wonderful dancer, in Korea. Though our time together was short, every conversation we had was heartfelt, and I could see how thoughtful and sincere you are. Every time, I could feel what a great person you are.

I wish you the best in your future endeavors, and I hope you’ll come back to Korea someday. Until then, I’ll keep dancing, and I hope we can look forward to meeting again. Truly, you’re not only a great dancer but also a great person.

Say hello to Stephanie for me, take care of your health, and when are you leaving?
