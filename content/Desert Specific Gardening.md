## Conclusions
- screen soil for bermuda grass - doubles as decompaction for soil - add mulch or coconut coir for organic matter and aeration if you can wait out nitrogen drain. Sand also will work.
- If caliche, consider clay spade or jack hammer
- pH often 8+, consider sulfur soil amendments
- 1 foot of mulch *minimum*
- targeted drip watering
- use downspout water
- use [[ipomea batatas]] for ground cover
- use [[moringa oleifera]] and [[ricinus communis]] for shade and as pioneers
- use Chinese elm for long term shade and value, maybe mulberry
- stay away from plants that need frost to fruit i.e. apple, peach unless you can identify a microclimate
- [[ficus carica]], [[punica granatum]], citrus, [[lavandula]], grapes, [[malpighia emarginata]], lemon grass, eggplant, [[ocimum basilicum]], and roses are a breeze. Hot mediterranean often works well, but careful of the need for well draining soil.
