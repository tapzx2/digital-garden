## Conclusions
- 1 foot of mulch
- targeted drip watering
- use [[ipomea batatas]] for ground cover
- use [[moringa oleifera]] and [[ricinus communis]] for shade and as pioneers
- use Chinese elm for long term shade and value, maybe mulberry
- stay away from plants that need frost to fruit i.e. apple, peach
- [[ficus carica]], [[punica granatum]], citrus, lavender, and roses are a breeze. Anything that works in hot Mediterranean really.
