Which do you want to do? Could be broken-barrel-learning-skills.excalidraw situation.
### Speed
Kill internal monolog using https://www.spreeder.com/app.php, use a pointer, group words, use peripheral vision.
### Comprehension
Approach non fiction non linearly. Be your own teacher and build your own knowledge lofi to hifi. Don't just read. Use the TOC, the first sentence of paragraphs, build keywords, scan and slow down when you find key points.
### Encoding
Use your brain and engage with content.

# Research

triforce method
spreeder to remove internal monologe
point at what you're reading
find nuggets - 80/20 rule
write summary / apply it

read visually, not verbally
read the middle of words (contraversal)
use a pointer
use metrics
write summary

argues trade off between comprehension and speed is too much
instead use "skimming", look at toc, headings, etc
hypothesizes that language processing is the factor

fiction vs non fiction distinction
fiction use a summary from someone else, then skim it
non fiction
have a purpose in mind when reading
make a skeleton from TOC, build a learning map for yourself and allocate time appropriately
use your brain: how does it relate to you, argue with it, do a tedtalk on it, how does it impact future you - [[How to study and learn]]

consider audiobook + actual book

if you have adhd, read multiple books at once - enter flow state by working on the things that seem most interesting at the time

group words
also, change format of book/website to improve efficiency

how to focus on difficult stuffs
1. scan for keywords to prime brain, these are the things you're looking for
2. do the skeleton thing with the first sentence, make sure it is something you want to read. And then read it fast / slow, looking for important key points. similar to 80/20. Justin calls this burst.

don't read linearly, learn the order you need. 900 pages over 3 days?
day 1: build general understanding, build anchor points
day 2: return to anchor points to improve understanding
day 3: focus on missed details
