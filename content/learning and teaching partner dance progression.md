Each item in this progression contains multiple skills beyond just doing the pattern. When teaching or self teaching (aka learning) identify the skills that are important to you and then use them as checks before moving on. When teaching a group class, you can adjust your expectations for the % of people who "get it". I am for 90 to 95% before moving on. If the skill sticks, you don't have to keep doing it.

i.e.

Doing the basic pattern x1 
- do they have the physical ability (not skill) to do it at all?
- do they start on the correct foot?
- can they keep the timing?
Doing the basic pattern x2
- do they start on the correct foot the second time?
- can they keep the timing?
Doing the basic pattern x4
- can they get to 4 w/o loosing the pattern?
- look for appropriate technique upgrades that will help with dancing with a partner i.e. feet closer together, more/less scoot, more/less pulse

How much or how little progression are applied depends on your audience. Super advanced class? Show them the pattern once or twice and let them try it. Then look for spots to refine. Do it to music and have them add it to their normal dancing.
