[[@Ryan Martin]] in comments on YouTube video of [[Styles of the Shag Double-Rhythm Basic]]:
 
"[[@Stephen Sayer|Steve]] and [[@Chandrae (Chanzie) Roettig Gomez|Chanzie]] have a unique style. But if I had to place them, I'd say they have the most in common with Connie and Barbara (Basic #5). They don't really have a lilt in their basic. Yet there is a very small amount of movement at the waist (like Connie and Barbara), which probably tells the follow what count her partner is on (like a lilt does). So it doesn't make sense to lump them in with the folks that do the whole heels up business (basic #4). And they hold a wider gait, like Connie and Barbara. The most important thing, though, is the fact that they're super smooth. Smoothness can be a relative thing, of course (i.e., a lilted basic can be smooth too, but it's a different kind of smooth). My point is, Connie and Barbara's smoothness shows in the fact that their heads don't move up and down hardly at all during the basic, which is the way Steve and Chanzie dance. They make it look effortless. â€¦I think Sailor Mike would also be a part of this same LA tradition. Smooth. Very little bounce. It works really well to faster music."
