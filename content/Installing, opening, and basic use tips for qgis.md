Because qgis is an open source project, it isn’t able to be verified easily by the MacOS operating system.

## Install and Open

1. [https://www.qgis.org/en/site/](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) download
2. on a Mac, RIGHT CLICK on the application the first time you open it. MacOS nerfs many options and this is a way to get around the first level of nerf.

## Use Tips

- qgis is a free open source tool. The other main tool is ArcGIS and it can cost up to $5,000 a year. Yes, qgis is clunky and sometimes irritating. But its free.
- Finding things is really easy using the help menu and typing in what you’re looking for.
