quick refresher on icon creation in figma https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBlF6VTLXOg

start with shapes, have hidden properties i.e. star you can adjust point and make more points. values on right. "shape primitives". extra spacing around shape is to establish center of mass. You can flatten shape and remove space. Keep in mind, will center better with bounding box on center of mass.

Vector points.

look at how different the A is from how I might draw it normally...

click on command / control and it will release beziay curve nodes. look at controls on right! you can really control things easily here.

look at bend tool for curves too.

hold shift key for straight line

snap settings important to how you work. look at snap settings if you feel like it isn't working correctly.

use grid, make heart with 3 points.

in figma with pen tool make vector design of pattern for reference so I don't get lost
