Considering the move that will eventually happen, getting a watering system installed. Front is almost finished, back is being planned.

6/8/2020
Front yard plan calls for 3 mulberry trees. 1 mulberry in the top corner of the yard one mulberry deadline is and one mulberry in the planter closest to Darlene's yard. 14 moringa trees in the front planting area. 11 varieties of stone fruit trees kept very small in the fair planting section that is was going to be the mulberry spot. I think we're moving a big hedge and pudding moringa trees in front of the window and maybe some pomegranate bushes at the base. Same probably for our bedroom window. Climber's can probably be put in the brick area as well. 8 marinas along the driveway side planters maybe squeeze at 10.
3 mulberry
32 moringa (some will die)
11 stone fruit
2 grape
5 pomegranates
12 roses

Ran the Drip for a couple hours at night
Watered the sugar cane cutting

6/3/2020
I'm sure I watered between this and the 20th. Fried pom is coming back from the roots which is great! It will be a great plant in the front yard, I'm really happy it survived (so far). Lime is completely gone it looks like. Small little bits of sap are coming out from places, could be root borers? The root stock is still fine. Growing off of the main trunk in several places. Will take video and ask about it in the group. I'm also wondering if the introduction of logs from other yards was the issue. Some of those logs were from diseased trees. I think the mini biting flies came from the big twisted log in the back. Renewed chip drop request. Next round of bulk pickup I'm still going to get more logs tho. I'm going to use them to border the new planting bed by Darlene's yard in the back. Currently thinking a compost toilet will go where the sugar cane is...need to do some measurements. Lemon tree is growing well. I'm considering putting a mulberry tree in the lime tree's place. Its actually a pretty good place for it. And if it gets a little big will provide a lot of shade for front door area of the house.

Fast Flood Watered 9am
- All trees in front, about 15 minutes on full for each tree except the lime.

I've done stuff in the garden since the 7th. Some watering, mostly collecting logs. The front yard is almost complete with log perimeters. Front new pomegranate is holding on for dear life with that shade in place. We will see if it survives the 107 that's coming next Wednesday. On Sunday I should water everything, front and back.

Did
- Removed bermuda growing in front
- some light weeding
- swept paths
Watered 12 noon
- flooded all trees in front yard

Has it really been 3 days since I was working in the garden? Possibly...
One of the moringas went pft, even with shade. There may be a chance to save it, but doubtful. Surinam cherries on side of the house looking bedragled, avocado is burning too. Persimmons look much happier now that they have some shade. Apple trees looking shaky? Can't tell if it is mid day wilt or is actually an issue. Most of the sweet potato slips look great. Trimmed several of the moringas to get them to be a little less leggy.  The two moringa seeds I planted in old hibiscus spots sprouted. 10 days from planting to seeing spouts. Good to know! Aggressively pruned three of the bougainvillea. I'd like to have them turn into tree shapes, rather than bushes, and come out from the house to make additional shade / shaping. I've seen other folks do it, I don't know if it is the right variety to make it happen.

Amazing by 6pm one of the brand new moringa sprouts went pft.

Did
- trimmed bougainvillea and morgina
- gave new moringa spouts shade
Watered 6pm
- All lemon grass
- Baby moringa
- Arugula
- Flooded sweet potato patch
- apples
- Barbados cherries
- Surname cherries

I've been doing things in the garden, but not recording it. Attempting to rebuild habit.
Past few days noticed the new pom in the front has leaves turning red and when I pulled on a few of them they came off easily. Maybe because of too much sun or too much water? Yet to find a good plant resource.
Did
- shaded new pom in front
Watered
- flooded new pom in front

Persimmon leaves looking wavy. Looked up diseases and didn't look like any, so I'm guessing sun / heat.
Put up shade for persimmon closest to path - living the green life recommends.
