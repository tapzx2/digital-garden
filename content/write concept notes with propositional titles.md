## Examples of Propositional Titles
from [[Seitz2021StarterPack]]

To modify "love thy neighbor" you might say "Loving your neighbor is vital for a well-functioning society". 

Here’s a few examples (italics) of how I was writing note titles, and how I’ve been trying to write them recently (bold)

_Relationship between art and truth_ becomes **Art is a means of disclosing reliable, true knowledge.**

_Literacy of Puritans in late 18th century America_ becomes **American Puritans of the late 18th century were highly literate.**

_Learning through linking_ becomes **Linking ideas together helps us remember ideas and use them.**

You get the idea. By distilling down a note into a single claim, it will help you focus the writing, and when scanning a list of titles or trying to write a link, you’ll be able to retrieve a _claim_ from memory much faster than a vague suggestive title.
