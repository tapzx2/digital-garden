There are two demographics I often teach collegiate shag. Strangely, they're quite similar.
1. absolute beginners
2. professionals

If someone is in between those two levels, I'm often teaching them *how* to dance than *what* to dance.

With both beginners and pros, I use similar conceptual models and progressions. With pros, we'll go behind the curtain of curated content and discuss it.

This is the progression I use for pros (or are so good at dancing they could be), written as a lead to a follow. For beginners, I'm often teaching them in groups and their experience is highly curated.

This progression is for professionals in a one to one session in about 1 or 2 hours. Adjust for yourself or your community as needed.
## Learning Collegiate Shag Basics

The base unit of shag is a **single pulse**.

i.e.
- One plus = a quick
- Two pulses = a slow
- Three pulses = part of fancy rhythms that 1% of dancers can lead / follow
- Four pulses = [[skates]] or [[collegiate kicks]]

You can mix and match the pulses with weight changes to create the [[shag rhythms]].
- Try leading / following all of those standard rhythms with your feet together, just doing weight changes and applying the rhythms.

In shag, you'll have the most success if you focus on the leg your weight is on. The free leg is the show, everyone looks at it, but it isn't the important leg. **Focus on the leg with your weight.*

There are several shag basics [[Styles of the Shag Double-Rhythm Basic]]. The one that will give you the most gains right is the [[basic - basic - step kick]]. 
- Try just the step kicks (the slows) of the [[basic - basic - step kick]]

The most important part of this shag is the scoot. This scoot will make you efficient and save you from exhaustion. Let's go in [[the six directions of movement]] and focus on the scoot.

Let's add in quicks. When I practice alone, I usually do [[basic - rhythm - single]] or [[basic - rhythm - triple]] because they're bilateral, helps to avoid building too asymmetry. Plus some really cool moves use these rhythms.
- Practice side by side if time allows.

Socially, unless you're dancing with other high level dancers, its 95% [[basic - rhythm - double]]. We'll move through all dance positions [[@Ryan Martin]] has listed in his [[Shag Lexicon]] *except* for closed. We'll need another basic for closed. The [[basic - basic - step kick]] is kinda awkward for that position. 
- Lead / follow different positions, turns, and passes. NO RHYTHM CHANGES.

For closed, I will often use the [[basic - basic - double kick]] as my default. This can be a regional thing. [[loc_Los Angeles]] will use this more. [[loc_Austin]] may use more of the [[basic - basic - arthur murray basic]].
- Pick one of the two and then practice transition from open to closed and changing basics.
- If time allows lead / follow different positions, turns, and passes and include transition into closed.

Lindy dancers often talk about low and grounded. Experienced shag dancers will use the whole spectrum. Others will just have one level and stay there. The important thing is to match with your partner. It will allow us to sync really well.
- Try high, medium, and low center of gravity while doing basic movements.

Rhythm work is being able to comfortably lead / follow however many pulses.  Use a relaxed tone and then when something changes, we may tone up, use more compression, or a hitch (or other level changes) to indicate a change. Once a rhythm is established, you can usually relax again.
- Leading / following mixed classic and modern rhythms with feet together, just doing weight changes and applying the rhythms.
- Now while dancing, do rhythms across positions, turns, and passes as comfort increases.

Let's quickly skim some shag specific motions to do before we're done:
- [[collegiate kicks]]
- [[bunny hops]]
- [[skates]]
- [[camel hops]]

Okay! Everything past this is refinement and there's shag specific lead/follow technique in some of the patterns.

For future partnered practices:
- Start with rhythm work.
- Dance a lot.
- Practice what you're interested in.

For solo practices:
- Focus on the scoot.
- Practice turns.
