There are two demographics I often teach collegiate shag. Strangely, they're quite similar.
1. absolute beginners
2. professionals

If someone is in between those two levels, I'm teaching them *how* to dance rather than *what* to dance.

With both beginners and pros, I use similar conceptual models and progressions. With pros, we'll go behind the curtain of curated content and discuss it.

This is the progression I use for pro level dancers. For beginners, I'm often teaching them in groups and their experience is highly curated.

This progression is for professionals in a one to one session in about 1 or 2 hours. Adjust as desired.
## Learning Collegiate Shag Basics
### Shag is One Pulse
I conceptualize the base unit of shag as a **single pulse**.

i.e.
- One pulse = a quick
- Two pulses = a slow
- Three pulses = part of fancy rhythms
- Four pulses = [[skates]] or [[collegiate kicks]]
- Six pulses = [[hesitation kicks]]
- Eight pulses = [[kick throughs]] or [[skates]]

You can mix and match the pulses with weight changes to create [[shag rhythms]].
- Try leading / following all of those standard rhythms with your feet together, just doing weight changes and applying the rhythms.

In shag, you'll have the most success if you focus on the leg your weight is on. The free leg is the show, everyone looks at it, but it isn't the important leg. **Focus on the leg with your weight.**
### Shag Rhythms and Patterns
And there are many [[Styles of the Shag Double-Rhythm Basic|shag footwork patterns]]. The one that will give you the most gains right away is the [[basic - basic - shuffle basic]].

Let's add in quicks. When I practice alone and want reps, I usually do [[basic - rhythm - single]] or [[basic - rhythm - triple]] because they're bilateral. This helps to avoid building too much asymmetry. Plus some really cool moves use these rhythms.
- Do the single and triple rhythm basic side by side.

However, unless you're dancing with other high level dancers, socially its 90% [[basic - rhythm - double]]. 
- Lead / follow different positions, turns, and passes. NO RHYTHM CHANGES.
#### Mix in the Step Kick + Scoot
The second basic to integrate is the [[basic - basic - step kick]]. This works well in all dance positions [[@Ryan Martin]] has listed in the [[Shag Lexicon]] *except* for closed. It *kinda* works in closed. I suggest using different basic for closed.
- Try just the step kicks (the slows) of the [[basic - basic - step kick]]

The most important part of this shag is the scoot. This scoot will make you efficient and save you from exhaustion. Introduce yourself to moving around with it.
- Try the [[the six directions of movement]] and focus on the scoot while doing the step kick.
- Try moving far and fast too!

For closed, I will often use the [[basic - basic - double kick]] as my default. This can be a regional thing. [[loc_Los Angeles]] will use this more. [[loc_Austin]] may use [[basic - basic - arthur murray basic]].
- Practice transition from open to closed and changing basics. Use the [[basic - basic - shuffle basic]] or [[basic - basic - arthur murray basic]] in closed and then the [[basic - basic - step kick]] in open.
- If time allows lead / follow different positions, turns, and passes and include transition into closed.
### Pulse and Center of Gravity
Beginners will often pulse high and stay there. Experienced shag dancers will use the whole spectrum. Socially, the important thing is to match with your partner. It will allow you to sync well and avoid exhaustion.
- Try high, medium, and low center of gravity while doing basic movements.

Rhythm work is being able to comfortably lead / follow however many pulses on each foot.  Use a relaxed tone and then when something changes, tone up, use more compression, try a lilt, or a hitch (or other level changes) to indicate a change. Once a rhythm is established, you can usually relax again.
- Lead and follow mixed rhythms with feet together, just doing weight changes and applying the rhythms.
- Lead and follow mixed rhythms in closed.
### More Steps
Let's quickly skim some common and iconic shag motions to do before we're done:
- [[collegiate kicks]]
- [[bunny hops]]
- [[skates]]
- [[camel hops]]
### Conclusion
Okay! That's enough for the first session.

For the second session the focus is on the [[Getting the Scoot in Shag]].
## Choose Your Own Adventure
There's shag specific lead/follow technique in many of the patterns.

For future partnered practices:
- Start with rhythm work.
- Dance a lot.
- Practice what you're interested in.

For solo practices:
- Focus on the scoot.
- Practice turns.
