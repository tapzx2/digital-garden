There are two demographics I often teach collegiate shag. Strangely, they're quite similar.
1. absolute beginners
2. professionals

If someone is in between those two levels, I'm often teaching them *how* to dance than *what* to dance.

With both beginners and pros, I use similar conceptual models and progressions. The difference of course is with pros we'll go behind the curtain of curated content for their experience and discuss it.

This is the progression I use for pros (or are so good at dancing they could be), written as a lead to a follow. For beginners, I'm often teaching them in groups. This is another whole layer of progression and presentation things that has to happen.

This progression is for professionals. Adjust for yourself or your community as needed. i.e.  [[learning and teaching partner dance progression]].
## Learning Collegiate Shag

There are a few [[shag rhythms]] and several shag basics [[Styles of the Shag Double-Rhythm Basic]]

There are multiple dance positions. [[@Ryan Martin]] in his [[Shag Lexicon]] has listed 9. There could be more depending on how you think about it.

But, we're going to think about those just yet!

1. Let's start with just the step kick of the [[basic - basic - step kick]] basic.
2. Now with a partner let's do it side by side in [[the six directions of movement]] to music.

Great, let's add the `qq` and do:

1. [[basic - rhythm - triple]]
2. [[basic - rhythm - single]]

Because these rhythms are bilateral, I use them when solo practicing any of the [[Styles of the Shag Double-Rhythm Basic]] to make sure I don't build imbalances.

Okay, let's do solo pratice the standard social rhythm and once that feels good we can import a bunch standard stuff into open position

1. [[basic - rhythm - double]]
2. positions, passes, turns

to be cont...
