Weâ€™re looking for single story ranch style homes with space around the property and minimal vegetation.

A 27 sq 4/12 house with no valleys and 3 facets. Many of the surrounding homes are similar in style. A perfect example!

We are not looking for difficult properties. Things that make a job difficult are steep pitch, tight lots, many facets, multiple stories, or shared roof ownership like town homes. These things often cause delays and increased risk.

This is an example of a job that we generally don't want. It will keep the company running, but won't grow it.
