## 2018 to Now - Swing Era
![[shag-photo-haily-holt-pdx-exchange.jpeg|200]]

While I still dance tango for fun and teach when asked, most of my focus is the swing dances, particularly Shag and Balboa. I'm doing my best to keep a log of all the [[Swing Dance Competition Accomplishments, Awards, and Performances]].

First intro to Shag was a class from [Kate Elisabeth](https://www.facebook.com/groups/158748710383061/user/578576302/?__cft__[0]=AZUthi4EtMM_B3eiSg5nIYhpqHY0FDV8tkTpn97tTof09oz9nn4CXzkEvNFzMF7yjIIsYDMnfiSjr8CqY5c3Z5u9omt8WG-h2ouVCtxIG9BnpexilcvUZy1HvuZiXdSgWYUp1sbIKLC7EN2NXlngPsYvs8DwbfhxfqyuKwqmAwIZYdJwlYBcEuSj-Kym40KytPE&__tn__=R]-R) and [Julie Roman](https://www.facebook.com/groups/158748710383061/user/10055357/?__cft__[0]=AZUthi4EtMM_B3eiSg5nIYhpqHY0FDV8tkTpn97tTof09oz9nn4CXzkEvNFzMF7yjIIsYDMnfiSjr8CqY5c3Z5u9omt8WG-h2ouVCtxIG9BnpexilcvUZy1HvuZiXdSgWYUp1sbIKLC7EN2NXlngPsYvs8DwbfhxfqyuKwqmAwIZYdJwlYBcEuSj-Kym40KytPE&__tn__=R]-R) in 2018 in Phoenix. Learned a bit from @Stephen Sayer and @Chandrae (Chanzie) Roettig Gomez. I was gifted several blood transfusions from @Julie Roman and that helped a lot. Planned to do a lot of traveling for Shag  in 2020... Back on track in 2023 and I've been enjoying participating in all the shag events and comps I can! I love coming up with new things, particularly rhythm changes. But realizing that all the things I'm "inventing" [Jeremy Otth](https://www.facebook.com/groups/158748710383061/user/838751389/?__cft__[0]=AZUthi4EtMM_B3eiSg5nIYhpqHY0FDV8tkTpn97tTof09oz9nn4CXzkEvNFzMF7yjIIsYDMnfiSjr8CqY5c3Z5u9omt8WG-h2ouVCtxIG9BnpexilcvUZy1HvuZiXdSgWYUp1sbIKLC7EN2NXlngPsYvs8DwbfhxfqyuKwqmAwIZYdJwlYBcEuSj-Kym40KytPE&__tn__=R]-R) already put on instagram. Practicing and teaching regularly around the world.

I'm currently working on putting together an expansive compendium in preparation to creating an online school. This is one of the article I've written to help sharpen my thinking and process: [[Collegiate Shag Demystified - A Simple Progression for Professional Dancers]]. I also write articles to help answer questions that I often hear from newer dancers. [[How to Get Men's Pants for Dancing]] is an example of something I wish I knew when I started!

As I'm getting older, I'm finding Balboa is calling my name. I dance Balboa when I'm too tired, lazy, stiff, sore, hurt, chill, calm, or achy to dance Shag. I dance Balboa often and I've been pleasantly surprised that a lot of Salsa and WCS and Tango vocabulary and techniques can be imported into the dance.

I dance Lindy Hop on teams or when the music is too slow for Shag or Balboa. I dance Blues when forced or tricked into it.
## 2010 to 2020 - Puro Tango
![[nico-stephie.jpg|300]]

 After studying in Argentina, in 2010 I began working independently as an Argentine Tango teacher. In 2014, my wife Stephanie and I won the USA Tango Championships and we decided to pursue dance full time. In late 2015 we moved to Phoenix, Arizona for economic opportunity.

We opened two studios, taught many private lessons, mentored to multiple national and international champions, and worked as instructors at UC Berkeley, Arizona State University, Empower College Prep, Arizona Opera, and Mesa Community College. Stephanie danced and acted in the Arizona Opera's production of [Maria de Buenos Aires](https://azopera.org/sites/default/files/styles/gallery_large__1200_wide_/public/photo_gallery/Maria%20de%20Buenos%20Aires_Photography%20Tim%20Trumble_14_0.JPG?itok=AwrXo5_X).

Combining all the tango training trips, I've lived in Buenos Aires for two years. This is why I have the Argentine accent while speaking in Spanish. All of my Spanish speaking friends make fun of me for it.

In [[Tango Class Recaps]] you can see a few class recaps from 2018 and 2019 when we teaching an open to all class in Phoenix at the language school [Interlingua](https://www.azinterlingua.com/). We had a dedicated group of students where we applied the format of teaching moves while emphasizing fundamentals and adding 15 minutes of candy (stage-ish stuff) at the end. 

After this [video](https://www.facebook.com/tapia.nicholas/videos/10107126818645137/) of us dancing for fun in April 2019, Steph's health started to take a turn for the worse. To continue dancing we detoured. I took up Lindy Hop and Shag and Steph started a coaching position with the [Phoenix Swing Project](https://www.phoenixswingproject.org/).
## 2005 to 2010 - Salsa and Ballroom
![[Pasted image 20241002180704.png]]

In 2004 I started with a general partner dance class. This was prompted by a cute girl asking me to go with her. I continued with dance and started learning salsa from a local community class in Orinda put on by [Tomaj Trenda](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2tZtOZgeWr/). In college I joined cotillion and learned ballroom dancing from the legendary [Kenji Ota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_and_Miye_Ota) and regularly went salsa dancing three nights a week. In 2009 I started working as an a new student specialist at Arthur Murray, Hayward.
