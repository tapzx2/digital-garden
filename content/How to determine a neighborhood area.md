If this is the kind of region we’re looking for, great! This would be the full Cedar Hills area. If this area is too big for the use case, continue on.

Because we create mental borders at physical barriers i.e. a river will denote the line between one country and another. In suburban areas, larger roadways perform this function. Think about walking a dog, you would not go past the exterior perimeter of your neighborhood. For a short walk, you might not leave the sub sections. This is an example of how the major roads create the envelope, and the through roads create the sub divisions.
