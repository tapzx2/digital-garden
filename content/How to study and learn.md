what are the things that hold you back? - learning baggage. Invisible negative habits. They are cognitive habits.

Learning is triggering techniques that happen in brain. Some of these techniques are negative, reducing memory and performance. This is how you can do the same thing as a top performer and get a different result. Make baggage visible with visible process mapping.

Infinite Staircase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3TgxIMt1cE
life is infinite staircase. challenges do not stop. each challenge is harder.
to overcome challenge: three methods: 
- effort first. reliance on your intelligence and motivation. leads to burn out
- effort second. first look at processes skills and attributes needed for challenge. and then develop them
- future proof approach. figure out next several challenges and upgrade appropriately.

but time?? 100 hrs of time. 80 is prep 20 is level 1 to level 2. + 10 hrs to level 6. time cost of upgrade is not linear.

1. figure out several next challenges
2. talk to people about those challenges. what were they and how did they over come? be humble.
3. create list of priorities.

How to Create The Perfect Mindmap (Advanced Guide)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grd7K7bJVWg

grinde
- group knowledge
- relate those group to each other
- interconnect one mind map to another, avoid islands
with these three, you've created a schema
- non verbal, make little drawings, really good for learning new stuff
- direction, should have arrows with a flow
- emphasized, should have areas bigger / bolder / more color, the "backbone" you'll need to reorganize, that's ok, part of recursive part of learning, its good

aka - "make it look pretty and understandable from a glance"

when it comes to learning, personalized means effective
best method: focus on weaknesses, because of broken barrel analogy
- silver bullet lol, doesn't exist
- strengths first, but you're only ask good as your weakest skill, so no. Similar to Communication and Speaking 101#^3e4310

deep processing (do you understand it)
self regulation (self reflective of learning skills)
mind set (willing to try and fail)
recall (spaced repetition)
self management (are you a procrastinator?)

How to Learn Complex Skills Quickly (And Forever)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHN7BXpdAPQ

complex skills are complex because of learning latency. 
Learning --------> result 
learning -> result (tie shoe)
RAIL
relevance, most effort is wasted because you are ignorant and don't know what's relevant. No knowledge guide rails or guide.
awareness, aka pleau, gotta make lots of mistakes. But...
Once you know how to overcome the mistakes, doing it correctly happens by default.
iteration, secure your awarness
life long, gotta practice or it will decay

buahah, its actually just the conscious competence stages. the value add is what you do at each stage tho.

PERRIO
priming your brain to learn. What do you do before an learning event? Class? Lecture? Study session? Tiago talks about this in second brain how he would review notes before meetings... people say wow so organized and smart! Nope, just primed.
encoding: relationships, grouping, organizing, simplifying (thinking)
reference: store it the details in Obsidian
retrieval: use it, reorganize it, maybe reps
interleaving: look at the knowledge in another way, try new combos, different lights
over learning: reps. Only needed for specific cases or very high competitive environments 

How to actually stick to your schedule
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-jbe-je5XM
over scheduling
estimate double time
flow state, you need to schedule your time ahead of time, not making cognitive decisions about what's next
but what about getting everything done? doesn't matter.
pick losses, play for championship

med school all over again
apply knowledge asap - think about how it is going to be applied, and then use that as framework for acquiring more knowledge. Can i do this with being a developer?
create play senarios for situations where you might be able to apply knowledge in real world. learning anatomy - sweet home surgery practice example
