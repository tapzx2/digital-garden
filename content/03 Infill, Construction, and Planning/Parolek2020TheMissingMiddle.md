## Missing Middle Is...
Between single family and high rise. Multiunit or cluster type ***compatible in scale with single family*** with urbanist metrics (walkability, price diversity). Usually 4-8 units in building or lot, up to 19.
## Bottom Line
People want it. *Really* good for the country. Existed historically. But, because of regulation, lack of systemic support, and uncertainty, it is hard to make it profitable now a days. Currently a niche market. But some are able to do it successfully. Cities effectively regulate these types with form-based coding.

People and Places Doing Good Works has tremendous networking value.

## Notes
### Quotes
"Even outside of the affordability and attainability conversation, the simple realities that 30 percent of all households across the country are single persons, that family sizes are decreasing, and that a large percentage of the population is aging and wanting to downsize are reasons enough to want to incentivize and remove the existing density-based barriers and disincentives for the delivery of small units." - pg 95

Because of their simple forms, smaller size, higher yields, and type V construction, Missing Middle building types can help developers maximize affordability and returns without compromising quality. - pg 45
### Scale and Form
Perceived density should be low. Use form and scale matters, not number of units, FAR (floor area ratio), lot coverage, or multifamily.

Fear of density. Have convos and get ahead of community or neighborhood opposition.
- Gather local examples (santa barbara story du/acre). Lots of image assets in Chapter 5 of book.  Excellent zoning reference as well for each type.
- Use local terms (if positive.)
- Frame convo: Missing Middle Housing, good list, House-scale, Housing choice, Attainability: where will teachers, firefighters, police, your children live in your community?
- DO NOT use terms density, multifamily, and upzoning.

good list: Duplex(side by side, stacked), cottage court, pocket neighborhood, fourplex stacked (1br/2br, parking vars), townhomes, triplex stacked, multiplex medium aka mansion apartment, courtyard building, live work. note most buildings can be alley/front loaded variations. note, live work was done really well in past, really bad today.

bad list: dingbat, slotted townhomes

> [!note]- more building details a la zoning and standards
> Two to two and a half stories maximum (Third story with careful consideration.)
> 
> House scale is 55-75 ft. maximum width along the street. Sometimes with wings that takes the total width up to 85 ft. along the street; 55-65 ft. maximum depth. Both the maximum width of the main body and the maximum width including the wings are important and thus crucial to regulate.
> 
> Maximum of one off-street parking space per unit, preferably not embedded in the building. Single-wide or narrow driveways if no alley is present.
> 
> Private open space is not needed and should not be required. Shared open space exists in the form of a rear yard, sometimes as a side a yard, or a courtyard.
> 
> Mix into block, put on "end grain", or put in transition to high density. aka small individual lot infill, secondary corridors, transitions from higher-intensity corridors. Downtown transitions, new growth edge areas. lol, good luck in zoned "single family neighborhoods"

### Money
Planning and zoning have setbacks, maximum densities, minimum lot sizes. This gap is often present even in recently updated zoning code. #opportunity

Identify #opportunity  by Review the Comprehensive Plans (City, County, or Both), Review the Small-Area Plans, Review Zoning. For how to specifically go about this, look at chapter 7.

Savvy developers use high end finishes and target walkability market and have no competition.

 construction types: V verses I or III

Chapter 6 has a few general profit loss breakdowns.
#### Barriers 
Larger buildings (125-150 units) provides easier-to-identify and often larger cost efficiencies than building four-, eight-, or even a sixteen-unit building or series of these buildings. Major reason larger builders and developers, who are looking for higher returns on their investments, are not building and why MM are mostly being built by smaller builders and developers.

re Manufacturing gains in construction Efficiencies can be found elsewhere, such as repeating unit plans and counting on-street parking toward parking requirements as shown in the Prairie Queen/Urban Waters case study.

> [!note]- Impact fees make multiple smaller units economically infeasible
Impact fees are charges paid by the developers of new developments to a municipality to provide new or expanded public facilities (such as roads, sewers, schools, fire and emergency response) required to serve that development. The big issue with impact fees, in terms of them providing a barrier for Missing Middle Housing, is that the fee charged for a unit is typically the same regardless of whether it is 5,000 sq. ft. or 500 sq. ft. Adjust impact fees based on unit size, SO smaller units pay less, and by context (infill versus greenfield).

The irony is that the unintended consequence of this type of pushback is that larger projects are incentivized because they are the only ones that have the funding and the tolerance to risk making it through entitlements. see @Jon Jon JPeg ig video about "bread" type housing and devleopment patterns - https://www.instagram.com/p/C4eHB-9Lx49/

Accessibility - added cost and complexity. 4+ has same codes as giant devs

A possible remedy would be the completion of a specific analysis of Missing Middle-scale buildings, three stories and nineteen units maximum, related to these building code requirements to determine if it would be possible for them to qualify for existing IRC requirements or similar, rather than more restrictive and costly IBC compliance. As far as the authors know, no such analysis is being considered. pg 107 #opportunity 
##### Condo Issues
Condo projects require builders to more insurance because of 2000s era laws. Builders *will* get sued. Difficult to get financing to build and to buy (FHA). Condos require HOAs and HOA formation costs are the same at any scale.
### Policy
RECOMMEND CHANGES TO PLANS, POLICIES, AND ZONING - see chapter 7
See case studies as well: oregon, twin cities, minneapolis, saint paul, michigan, atlanta georgia, nashville, chattanooga, california, include Grass Valley, Ventura, Livermore, Petaluma, Hercules,
Benicia, and Paso Robles.
