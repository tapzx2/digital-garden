Applying [[How to Read Fast]], [[How to study and learn]], PKM system - Knowledge organization, acquisition, and production|PKM system

Skelton from Columbia University [Construction Management Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/construction-management)
1. Construction Project Management
2. Construction Scheduling
3. [Construction Cost Estimating and Cost Control](https://www.coursera.org/learn/construction-cost-estimating?specialization=construction-management)
4. Construction Finance
5. The Construction Industry: The Way Forward (Construction Industry Overview, Sustainability in the Construction Industry, Building Information Modeling and Technology Trends in Construction)

Initial Questions

What is construction scheduling? Is it more unique than understanding the trades timelines and delivering appropriately?
What's unique about cost estimating or control?
Construction Finance I don't know anything about. Finance in general so there's a hole.
Future of industry would be interesting.

Ian Taylor, project manager for Turner and Townsend, introduces the stages of design in a construction project.
types of cost estimates in a construction project. Also covered in this module are the tools and methods used to create estimates.
discuss Quantity Take Off and Measurement. Estimating cut and fill costs is taught along with a detailed example of using cut and fill software. Also covered in this module is the topic of deep foundations, concrete foundations and structural steel, measurement, masonry, glass curtain wall, facade and wall finishes.
discusses pricing, labor costs and equipment costs. Topics include, cost materials, formwork, reinforcing steel and concrete. Money component and productivity component is discussed in labor costs, as well as estimating equipment costs.
illustrates how to build an estimate. Sneath does a deep dive into a schematic design project.
discussed the procurement stage of a construction projects and they typical involvement of a cost manager or cost estimator.
discusses post contract and cost estimation with a construction project. Also covered in this module are cost reporting, change orders and communication and meetings.
construction cost control and the work segments contained in a project.
 Earned Value Method of Cost Control.
  introduces cost management close out and punch-list review.
   talks about cost estimation in general practice. The unit starts with tips in cost estimating and cost management and ends with a discussion of the international roles of cost managers.
   discusses contracts and cash flows. Revenues, expenses and how they impact projects as a whole will be covered.
   discusses technology trends in cost estimating and cost control. Topics include 5D Estimating Systems (BIM), estimating software, technology workflows, and implementation.
   discusses cost control for large programs.
   presents this module on Lean In Cost Control.
# 1. Construction Project Initiation and Planning
The five phases are: pre-design, design, procurement, construction and monitoring, and post-construction. There are also [sub phases](https://www.mastt.com/blogs/construction-project-management-lifecycle-overview).

Have a good Construction Contract Types|contract that sets forth terms of how things are gonna go. Lot's of variety here, lots of different ways to divide up risk and responsibility. The contracts also say how things get done aka Construction Project Delivery Methods|project delivery methods. Surety bonds are often required so people stick to their word. Costs about .5 to 3% depending on insurers formulas.

> [!note]- Surety Bonding
[basics of surety bonding](https://dot.alaska.gov/cvlrts/pdfs/HUB-International-Presentation.pdf)  3 person agreement between principal (contractor), obligee (often a government entity), and surety. Obligee is protected if principal defaults. Surety will pay. And the principal will settle with the surety. No losses expected. Uses 3Cs to determine. Capital Capacity Charter (project size, the contractor's creditworthiness, and the bond amount). Came about because of Miller act of 1935. Protects Owner, Builder, Sub 1, and Sub 2. But what about sub 3? Is this how Trump didn't pay? Slightly different from insurance where it is 2 parties and losses are expected. Instead, a surety bond is more like credit earmarked for cases of default. They cost between .5% and 3% of project to purchase. There are [different types of surety bonds](https://www.nspe.org/sites/default/files/resources/pdfs/Licensure/FTC/FTC-Jun-02-GuideSuretyBonds.pdf) for each phase of the project.
 
You can use construction cost codes, BIM, and a [work breakdown structure](https://www.smartsheet.com/content/construction-work-breakdown-structure)  so stakeholders know you're organized and legit and they can trust you know what you're doing. Having your  managerial accounting, empowered by cost codes, in good shape means you're going to be in business so people can trust you.

If you're managing lots of projects (and managers), you're a program manager.

Construction (changing sites, custom, high skill labor) vs manufacturing processes (one site, repetitive, low skill labor). Manufacturing gains in construction focuses on how to reduce costs.
### Questions
 - Are there good infill developers? - yes

	 - https://rpa.org/work/reports/how-six-cities-are-creating-missing-middle-housing
 - What kind of manufacturing gains could be applied to make them more profitable?
- What does lofi to highfi bidding/quoting iteration process look like for complex projects?
# 2. Construction Scheduling
Gotta schedule good and manage delays. Lots of ways to do this, not all that difficult, just need to follow procedure. 

> [!note]- Scheduling Keywords
differences between calendar dates and work dates
Gantt charts
Activity Precedence Diagrams, also referred to as Activity on Node Diagrams, which graphically represent the construction activities in a project and their relationships
types of construction activity relationships encountered in a construction project and how to represent them in an activity precedence diagram
Forward and Backward Pass Calculations are covered in this module. Forward Pass Calculations determine the minimum dates at which each construction activity can be performed and, ultimately, the minimum duration of a construction project. Backward Pass Calculations compute the latest dates by which each construction activity can be performed without increasing the projects minimum duration.
critical path??
activity float - total float, free float, interfering float and independent float. - how much delay slack and cause and effect are we talking about for each activity
Activity on Arrow diagrams
The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is introduced in this module which relates to uncertainty in estimating the duration of construction activities in a project schedule. PERT helps project managers determine the probability of a project being completed in a certain number of days.
discusses the role of the scheduler in a construction project 
linear construction; projects that have linear, or repetitive, properties. Also covered is the Line of Balance scheduling method which is a way of allocating resources for repetitive processes.
Integrated Master Schedule and identifies key features
Risk Allocation and Planning
