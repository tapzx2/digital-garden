## Log

Designed wood fence is clear white cedar. Designed to replicate the visual depiction of a bamboo fence.

Bamboo quarter replace fence in the front of the house once a year. Depending on people that could be between 1 and 10 years for back of the house replacement.

Tea garden calls for the simplest form of bamboo fence. Typically it's something that the team master or owner of the tea House will do.

Bamboo canes of Japanese garden can be prune frequently. This allows you to control both height and number and thickness. You can cut back to the ground. If The bamboo foliage is not heavy then the roots don't have to push out and expand. This is the main thing that helps you control bamboo growth. Note that there are 600 700 year old bamboo portions inside homes In Japan that have not destroyed their courtyards or patios.

Traditionally a student will go and make this fence in the master will fall behind them cutting off the knots that suck ass. The Masters will also be watching to make sure that they aren't wasting too much material.

For cedar posts you can not dimension but harvest as is and use the round posts and it will last 50 to 100 years. 

The fountain there is a clay pot that is upside down with a hole in it creates a resonating sound so that you can really hear the water. Every 20 years you have to take up the pot, clean up, put it back in. 

Japanese gardening there is constant maintenance and continuous improvement and never stops.

For Japanese pruting they're doing incremental small pruning all the time particular focus on summer because that's  when you're outside. There's no bad time to prune. 

Once bamboo flowers its probably done. But, if you clear cut the whole thing or you could take off all the flowers it will prolong the life of the bamboo. The flowering cycle is 60 to 70 years (?) maybe. Depends on bamboo. There's some really interesting research on the giant bamboo check it out.

Age of bamboo 4 to 7 years is ideal before harvesting. 9 to 10 years it starts to deteriorate. September is the ideal time to harvest because it's the time of lowest sugar content and the bugs won't get in. This is in Japan where it has a clear four seasons.

Bamboo Design Options
- fences
- delineations
- grates
- fountains
- edging
- gutters
- downspouts (travels outside of bamboo)
- erosion control (make little small fences then you plant all along those bamboo places and then in 15 years once the bamboo disintegrates you have a vegetative hedge that prevents the erosion)
- plant/tree supporters
- hide fire hydrants
- Gate. Shiori-do gate.
- Ladders. They are very stable and tell you much before they break.
- rakes, brooms, dustpans

## Building a Fence

For long bamboo fence think about 7 ft between posts. You can use bamboo horizontal to support in the middle so no sagging. Put groves in posts so bamboo can sit.

Notice that top is node cut. On vertical pieces. This is my structurally sound and it traps due in the morning. This helps to slow down the drying process and prevent splitting.

Making the fence. Drive posts. End posts should be inches taller.

### Knot

Working on tying the fence... Make sure black twine is wet Don't want to dry out. Do not allow any criss crossing of the twine think about parallel railroad tracks. Flip up the loop before pulling tight. You can pull single strands to pull tight.

Don't move your left hand once you've pinned it.

Think about building and holding tension with the rope, not your hands. 

When making the transition of free end and creating the base end loop, the "aha" moment was realizing you can pitch with a longer part of your thumb and pointer. Not just the tip. This allows you to maintain hold on the loop pieces and slip the free end out of the pitch and allow the base end loop into the pinch.
