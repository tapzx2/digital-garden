Note to self - Incorporate: Tiago's general guidance on knowledge management. Consider growing into two articles: general philosophy (platform agnostic, low friction, flexible, no duplicates, findability) and into nuts and bolts (atomicity, names, folders, tags).

A documentation system needs to be easy to setup and maintain, adaptable, and low friction.

This is a quick summary on organizing SOPs. This article covers how to make SOPs easily scannable, easy to categorize, and easy to find.

Unless the SOP writing platform or the organization requires it, it is unnecessary to start with extensive organizational architecture. Having a general plan is enough.

These are the organizational tools we have:

## Atomic Notes
There are two ways to write an SOP
1. atomic 
2. long and detailed

Much has been written about this in the PKM and programing communities. The applied TL;DR is that if you have subsections of an SOP that can be made into their own SOPs, consider doing it for readability, findability, and low friction updates. If it is better to leave it long, leave it long.

Certain SOPs are a little more like home pages, giving general jumping off points to other SOPs. In cases like this, multiple resources are intelligently aggregated into a list or general how to page. 
## File Names, Folders, and Tags
These three things all work together to organize your documents so you can find them either through a search bar or through folder hierarchy.

Based on my own experience and that of productivity many organizational gurus like @Tiago Forte, @Nick Milo, and @Anne-Laure Le Cunff, it is my strong opinion that in general, folder structures and tags should be made ONLY when the need arises. BUT, having a plan before you start is essential for organizations.
### File Names
Make titles clear and descriptive by distilling the SOP into a clear and if possible, single write concept notes with propositional titles|concept. For example:
- [[Neighborhood mailer marketing sop]]
- [[How to determine a neighborhood area]]
- [[How to zoom to an address in qgis]]

![[Quick Start to Writing SOPs#^098337]]

When it comes to scanning a list of titles or trying to connect one SOP to another, youâ€™ll be able see the title or retrieve keywords from memory much faster than a generalist title like:
- direct marketing
- neighborhood area
- qgis zooming
### Folders and Tags
Once you have enough SOPs and you may need another layer of organization. Both folders and tags help with organizing and with finding information. Folders are a structured hierarchy and tags are very flexible. They do not work in opposition to each other, they are complimentary! @Tiago Forte wrote an excellent [article](https://fortelabs.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-tagging-for-personal-knowledge-management/) on this.
#### Folders
Content is usually organized into folders.

Typically this is the finder, or in web apps the left side bar. This is for manual file navigation. A big upside is it gives people a concrete structure to navigate, with folders and labels giving them visual feedback and control in incremental steps.

Systems have been developed for how to make folders. It is surprising that something so seemingly mundane has had so many hours of thought poured into it.

As annoying as it might be, "it depends" is probably the most accurate answer to "How should we structure our folders?" Which one you go with depends on the organizational needs and the platform you're using for the SOPs.

In my opinion, the most important thing is not over do or over think. Just go with something simple and let more structure arise as needed.
#### Tags
Tags fill in the gaps of a folder structure. As an example, an SOP that lives in the `~marketing/neighborhood mailer` folder needs to be finished. Instead creating and moving it to Nicholas' to be completed folder, leave it where it is and tag it as `#nicholas` and `#todo`.

How you create implement and manage tags, again depends on the organizational needs and the platform you're using.
## Platform
While these concepts are platform agnostic, the details of how to implement them, and how easy it is to implement them depends the platform. [[How to Pick the Right SOP Platform]]
