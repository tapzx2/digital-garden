2024-09-13 Guayabera shirt sleeve repair. Starting project file on [[Guayabera Embroidery Repairs]]

2024-09-09 Epoxy repair + added canvas patch on heel of left shoe and small reenforcement on part of shoe that has frayed on right. Would have preferred white, but could only find canvas in yellow. Better than no shoe!

Small hole repair on sweatpants. A far cry from Japanese technique for repairing holes kaketsugi, but perfectly acceptable. Used theory from visible mending technique for clothes. Wouldn't mind a loop next time.

Attempt at tailoring shirt. Disaster. With practice would be good. Not that difficult, but maybe more challenging to get right on first attempt. Recommend continuous practice on same shirt.

Attempt at tailoring pants. Success. Small pucker. First properly waisted pants EVER. VERY excited about them!!! Featured in later article: [[How to Get Men's Pants for Dancing]] 5 or 6 attempts at getting this right. Very forgiving.

Shorts? Underwear? Not sure. Freeform attempt at making coverings for bottom half. Didn't take into account seam allowance. Can't fit on body.
