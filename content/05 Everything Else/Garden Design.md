I love gardens! Both growing and visiting them. From 2015 - 2021 my focus was our Phoenix backyard garden. My inspiration came from visiting friends with productive yards and the dream boat [Monty Don](https://www.montydon.com/). The show [Big Dreams Small Spaces](https://www.google.com/search?q=big+dreams+small+spaces) was a huge catalyst. Right now I don't get to get my hands dirty as much as I would like. Currently, I enjoy a visiting gardens around the world. I keep a very messy [garden inspiration folder](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipNB_Gx8fcjH_DJDszX-XZEyYQE-7yDmw6YR3Cuy) from my travels. Here's a log of my [[garden design education]].

Gardening in Phoenix was a bit of a challenge. People from Iraq are in the Phoenix gardening groups because we have a similar climate. It freezes enough to be dangerous to tropicals, it gets really hot, and there's not much water. 

Some strengths of the Phoenix area: it was an agricultural center and has many of the legacy businesses, it has good dirt, and some very successful gardeners like [Jake Mace](https://youtu.be/rygts1nOn44?t=240), [Shamus O'Leary](https://www.greenlifebyshamusoleary.com/), and [Greg Peterson](https://www.urbanfarm.org/courses-2/faculty/gr/) live here and provide free advice.

Some great resources are [Chip Drop](https://getchipdrop.com/) and free stuff from neighbors and friends, and big sales at nurseries.

Threats: disgruntled neighbors, city regulations, pests, and [severe heat](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-weather/2020/09/05/phoenix-august-summer-2020-hottest-history/5729955002/) / cold.

The main tenants of the yard came to be:
- make shade
- choose abuse tolerant, edible plants
- mulch A LOT
- add sulfur
