## Process
### Spec
Issues
- I forget what I do on which day.
- The calendar schedules are overwhelming + links don't always work.
- The internet is slow out of the house (map and calendars). Not easy to reference.

Want
- Easy reference that's fast.
- The reference is easily updated and fun to make.

Solution
- A map calendar.
### Design
1. Web search for map inspo. Hand drawn looks nice!
3. Outline base map area in procreate - easy future update if needed.
4. Import to figma and add points - easy update + backed up.
5. Design escalator marks.
6. Use https://colorbrewer2.org/ for color scheme.
7. Export and add to Obsidian for sync to phone.
